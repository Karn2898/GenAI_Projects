The primary objectives are to:  \\n\\u2022 Supplement resume information  \\n\\u2022 Show that you understand your strengths and weaknesses and have a \\nsense of direction  \\n\\u2022 Enable the employer to evaluate your personality and attitudes in \\nterms of the demands of the organization and the position  \\n\\u2022 Allow you to gain information about the organization and the job \\nthat is not available through other sources  \\n\\u2022 Give you and the employer an opportunity to discuss the desirability \\nof further contact or an offer of employment  \\nThe interview is a two-way process. You evaluate the employer while \\nhe/she evaluates you. Since there is no one way of interviewing, you will \\nhave to develop your own style. In order to present yourself well during \\nthe interview, you must be prepared. Preparation builds confidence and \\nenables you to give a better presentation of your qualifications. \\nINTERVIEW PREPARATION  \\nFirst Impressions \\nYour success or failure in an interview can depend on your appearance \\nand the interviewer's first impression of you. Research indicates that, on \\naverage, an interviewer decides to hire in just 5\\u00bd minutes. If the first \\nimpression is not positive, it will be difficult to change the interviewer's \\nmind during the rest of the interview.  \\nBe punctual. Arrive 10 minutes early to allow yourself time to collect \\nyour thoughts. Take the opportunity to observe the work environment. \\nKeep your eyes and ears open.  \\nLook professional\\u2014neat, clean, and well groomed. Select proper \\nclothing for the type of organization interviewing you. If in doubt, be \\nconservative. It is also advisable to keep fashion accessories to a \\nminimum, to avoid wearing strong scents, and to turn off devices such as \\ncell phones and electronic organizers. \\nGreet each person with respect and professionalism. When you shake \\nhands, make eye contact and smile. Handshakes should be firm but not \\naggressive; try to match the grip of the interviewer. It is good etiquette \\nto wait to sit down until the interviewer invites you to do so.  \\nKnow the Company/Organization \\nYou must be familiar with the position and the organization so that you \\ncan demonstrate your interest in and fit for the job. Refer to the \\nresearch notes you made as you reviewed print and online materials, \\nspoke with people about the position, and prepared your resume and \\ncover letter. \\n \\nINTERVIEW CHECKLIST: \\n\\u2022 5-10 copies of your resume \\n\\u2022 A portfolio/notebook  \\n\\u2022 Pen/pencil \\n\\u2022 Questions for the interviewers \\n\\u2022 Positive attitude \\n\\u2022 Professionally dressed \\n \\nPROFESSIONAL ATTIRE: \\n\\u2022 Solid color, conservative suit \\n\\u2022 Coordinated blouse/shirt \\n\\u2022 Minimal jewelry/accessories/tie \\n\\u2022 Moderate shoes \\n\\u2022 Neat, professional hairstyle \\n\\u2022 Manicured nails\",\n          \"prospective employer wants you to complete. If you do not have a \\nsimilar experience to relate, try to choose a relevant story from your \\nacademic, extracurricular, or volunteer activities.  \\nChoose words that will help the employer visualize you in the \\nexperience. Whenever possible, include positive feedback from \\nsupervisors, colleagues, professors, and others to reinforce your \\naccomplishment.  \\nThe next step is the one that most candidates forget. Tell the interviewer \\nwhat specific benefits or competitive advantage you can bring to the \\nposition because of the experience you have just described. For example, \\n\\\"As part of the team, I would be able to coordinate....\\\" Avoid generic \\nstatements such as \\\"All organizations need people with leadership ability.\\\"  \\nSituational/Hypothetical Questions  \\nAn interviewer will use situational/hypothetical questions to establish \\nhow you would react to and handle real-life situations on the job. For \\nsituational/hypothetical questions, candidates must have a good \\nunderstanding of the job and its requirements.  \\nHere are some examples of this type of question: \\n\\u2022 If you had met your project deadlines and your direct supervisor was \\nunavailable, describe how you would remain busy.  \\n\\u2022 You are the manager of a small marketing team, and one individual is \\ncontinually late for work and taking extended breaks. How would you \\napproach the issue?  \\n\\u2022 During construction, a contractor unexpectedly finds a very large \\nobject in one of the trenches where he is about to dig. He requests \\nthat you tell him how to proceed. How would you deal with this \\nsituation?  \\n\\u2022 You plan a workshop to teach newcomers to the country how to use \\nword processing software. Unfortunately, only four people have \\nregistered and you are required to have a class of ten. It is five days \\nbefore the class is scheduled to begin. What do you do?  \\n\\u2022 You have a conflict with someone who is senior to you and is not \\nyour supervisor. Describe how you would handle it.  \\n \\nCLASSIC QUESTIONS \\nIn addition to asking the other \\ntypes of questions, many employers \\nrely on a series of standard \\nquestions, and you should prepare \\nfor them: \\n \\n\\u2022 Tell me about yourself. \\n\\u2022 What are your short-term \\ngoals? What about in two and \\nfive years?

The primary objectives are to:  \\n• Supplement resume information  \\n• Show that you understand your strengths and weaknesses and have a \\nsense of direction  \\n• Enable the employer to evaluate your personality and attitudes in \\nterms of the demands of the organization and the position  \\n• Allow you to gain information about the organization and the job \\nthat is not available through other sources  \\n• Give you and the employer an opportunity to discuss the desirability \\nof further contact or an offer of employment  \\nThe interview is a two-way process. You evaluate the employer while \\nhe/she evaluates you. Since there is no one way of interviewing, you will \\nhave to develop your own style. In order to present yourself well during \\nthe interview, you must be prepared. Preparation builds confidence and \\nenables you to give a better presentation of your qualifications. \\nINTERVIEW PREPARATION  \\nFirst Impressions \\nYour success or failure in an interview can depend on your appearance \\nand the interviewer's first impression of you. Research indicates that, on \\naverage, an interviewer decides to hire in just 5½ minutes. If the first \\nimpression is not positive, it will be difficult to change the interviewer's \\nmind during the rest of the interview.  \\nBe punctual. Arrive 10 minutes early to allow yourself time to collect \\nyour thoughts. Take the opportunity to observe the work environment. \\nKeep your eyes and ears open.  \\nLook professional—neat, clean, and well groomed. Select proper \\nclothing for the type of organization interviewing you. If in doubt, be \\nconservative. It is also advisable to keep fashion accessories to a \\nminimum, to avoid wearing strong scents, and to turn off devices such as \\ncell phones and electronic organizers. \\nGreet each person with respect and professionalism. When you shake \\nhands, make eye contact and smile. Handshakes should be firm but not \\naggressive; try to match the grip of the interviewer. It is good etiquette \\nto wait to sit down until the interviewer invites you to do so.  \\nKnow the Company/Organization \\nYou must be familiar with the position and the organization so that you \\ncan demonstrate your interest in and fit for the job. Refer to the \\nresearch notes you made as you reviewed print and online materials, \\nspoke with people about the position, and prepared your resume and \\ncover letter. \\n \\nINTERVIEW CHECKLIST: \\n• 5-10 copies of your resume \\n• A portfolio/notebook  \\n• Pen/pencil \\n• Questions for the interviewers \\n• Positive attitude \\n• Professionally dressed \\n \\nPROFESSIONAL ATTIRE: \\n• Solid color, conservative suit \\n• Coordinated blouse/shirt \\n• Minimal jewelry/accessories/tie \\n• Moderate shoes \\n• Neat, professional hairstyle \\n• Manicured nails\"),\n",

To increase your \\nconfidence and prepare for an \\ninterview, practice interviewing. \\nCheck for quality of information \\nin your answers, and the \\npositive, non-verbal \\nreinforcement of your words. \\nBy practicing responses out \\nloud, you can hear your \\nanswers and assess their \\neffectiveness; however, don't \\npractice so much that you lose \\nyour spontaneity and your \\nanswers sound rehearsed. \\nThe key to tricky situations is \\nto remember that barriers to \\nemployment can often be \\novercome by focusing on the \\npositive. Circumstances that \\nyou may find problematic are: \\n1. Salary  \\n2. Silence  \\n3. Interviewer is an excessive \\ntalker  \\n4. Note-taking  \\n5. Being stumped  \\n6. Negative questions  \\n7. Many short-term jobs or \\ngaps in employment history  \\n8. Having never worked or no \\nrecent work experience  \\n9. Being over-/under-qualified  \\n10. Low grades  \\n11. Ageism  \\n12. Disclosure of disability  \\n13. Reasons for leaving last job  \\n14. Poor or no references  \\n15. Proprietary information  \\n \\nSALARY \\nIf applying for short-term work (such as co-op or summer positions), you \\nwill likely have only one interview, so it is acceptable to discuss salary. If \\nyou need to know the salary and it has not been discussed, ask about it as \\nyour final question. \\nEmployers hiring full-time or contract staff may inquire about salary \\nduring a first interview to see if your expectations are compatible with \\nwhat they are offering and to see how much value you place on your \\nexperience, skills, and educational background. Try to defer the subject \\nuntil you have been offered the job, but if the employer insists, be \\nprepared to offer a salary range that you know is realistic based on your \\nresearch.  \\nOver eighty percent of employers expect you to negotiate salary. \\nTherefore, it is appropriate to do your salary research and develop a \\nnegotiation strategy. Visit the Career Development Center to discuss \\nsalary negotiation techniques with a career counselor. \\nSILENCE \\nIf you answer a question and there is no prompt response or follow-up \\nquestion, what do you do? Try to remain calm and collected. Silence may \\nnot be a negative sign; the employer could be taking time to process and \\nrecord your answer or could be considering the next question. A few \\nemployers create periods of silence during an interview to see how \\ncandidates handle stressful and awkward situations.  \\nIn response to uncomfortable silence, ask the interviewers if they require \\nany further details regarding your last response, shifting the responsibility \\nto them. Resist the temptation to ramble because you may provide \\nirrelevant information that may hurt your chances of being offered the \\njob. \\nNOTE-TAKING \\nAlthough the interviewer will likely take notes, generally you should take \\nbasic notes. If you have your head down writing everything frantically, the \\nconversation will be uncomfortable and disengaged because of your lack \\nof eye contact and inability to show enthusiasm. \\nMaking brief notes is acceptable when you need to record information \\nthat may be easily forgotten, such as a key word, phone number or \\ncontact information. If you fear you may not recall other pertinent \\ndetails, document the information immediately after the interview.\"),\n",

The key is to remain calm and positive, focus on the question, \\nand continue to remind yourself that you are doing well. You may \\nrequest clarification if you are not sure what the interviewer is asking or \\npause and politely ask for a few moments to consider your response; \\nhowever, don\\'t take too much time because employers want to see that \\nyou can think well under pressure. \\nAfter a brief pause, if you still cannot respond to the interviewer\\'s \\nquestion, you may ask to defer your answer to the end of the interview. \\nThe risk is that interviews usually follow a certain structure and the \\nquestion might be missed entirely, leaving the interviewer with an \\nunanswered question. Of course, if you’re stumped because you simply \\ndo not know the answer, be honest with the interviewer in a positive \\nand professional manner. \\nWhen asked a question about a skill that you don\\'t have, demonstrate \\nthat you have the transferable skills necessary to succeed in the position. \\nFor example, \"I have excellent computer skills but I do not have \\nknowledge of that specific software.

The following are a few examples:  \\n• What are your weaknesses as an employee?  \\n• Recall a time from your work experience when you made a bad \\ndecision or mistake. How did you get beyond it?  \\n• Give me an example of a time you did not meet a project \\ndeadline. How did you handle the situation?  \\nBe honest and discuss a real work-related weakness or past event that \\nwould not negatively impact performance for the job you are applying \\nfor. Avoid the popular advice to turn a weakness into a strength (for \\nexample, \"I\\'m a perfectionist...\") because this kind of response is \\nunconvincing and over used. Be sure to end your \"weakness\" response \\non a positive note by indicating what steps you are taking to overcome \\nthe weakness. \\nIt is important to be as positive as possible, even when answering a \\nnegatively framed question, and to keep your answer short.'),\n",

In \\ncreating a targeted resume, you may also have chosen to omit some \\nexperiences. \\nAlthough you should truthfully explain in a few words the reasons for \\nyour job changes or gaps in employment, focus on what you did during \\nthe gaps that was related to the position. \\nHAVING NEVER WORKED OR NO RECENT \\nWORK EXPERIENCE  \\nTell the interviewer about any relevant courses, workshops, volunteer or \\ninternship experiences, and extracurricular activities.

Counter the interviewer\\'s fear that you may \\nnot be suitable by emphasizing your positive traits and describing how \\nyour experience, education, and skills will help you succeed in the \\nposition.

Honestly and concisely state your reasons for \\nleaving. If you left on good terms, offer the interviewer letters of \\nreference that outline your relevant achievements. If the conditions under \\nwhich you left were negative, focus the interviewer’s attention on what \\nyou accomplished and avoid speaking negatively about past managers, \\ncolleagues or the organization.

However, the \\nlaw does not distinguish \\nbetween the interviewer who is \\nasking questions with the intent \\nto discriminate and the one \\nwho is just curious or inept at \\ninterviewing. \\nSome questions are \\ninappropriate and others are \\nillegal. You do not have to \\nanswer questions that are illegal. \\nMost regions have laws that \\nprohibit discrimination in \\nemployment on the grounds of: \\n• Race  \\n• Ancestry  \\n• Place of origin  \\n• Ethnic origin  \\n• Citizenship  \\n• Religion  \\n• Gender  \\n• Age  \\n• Record of offences  \\n• Marital status  \\n• Family status  \\n• Disability  \\n• Medical history  \\n \\nPROPRIETARY INFORMATION \\nIf you are asked to provide confidential information about a past \\nemployer, it is best to refrain from giving any information that is not \\npublicly available. Revealing information about a past employer, who may \\nor may not be a competitor, could create a breach of confidentiality. \\nEven though you may have worked for this employer some time ago, you \\nare still obligated to keep confidential information private. The \\ninterviewer could be testing to see if you divulge any company \\ninformation because doing so may be an indicator that you will reveal \\nconfidential information about the interviewer\\'s company.  \\nIf your portfolio includes performance reviews or samples of written \\nwork, ensure that no proprietary information is included, such as the \\nnames of customers or clients.  \\nHANDLING ILLEGAL QUESTIONS \\nWhat should you do if you\\'re in the middle of an interview and have just \\nbeen asked what is clearly an illegal question? There is no clear-cut \\nanswer. Much depends on you. \\nIn some cases, you may be able to answer the \"hidden\" question. Think of \\nwhat information the employer is trying to elicit. For example, \"Do you \\nhave or plan to have children?\" may indicate a concern about an ability to \\nwork overtime or to travel. In this example, your answer should convey \\nyour willingness to maintain a flexible work schedule. You may elect to \\nsay \"Why do you ask?\" or \"Would you explain how this point is \\nconnected to the qualifications for this job?\" This could cause the \\nemployer to reconsider or clarify the question. It may offend some \\nemployers, but probably not the majority. \\nIf you feel that you should not answer the question (you shouldn\\'t have \\nto, after all) or that you are not interested in working for the company, \\nyou may state, \"I don\\'t feel obligated to answer personal questions \\nunrelated to the position\" or \"That question seems inappropriate for an \\ninterview.\" If you choose this option, you will either enlighten (the \\nemployer may not realize it is illegal and will be happy that you pointed it \\nout) or offend (the employer may not consider you for the position). \\nFor more information about illegal interview questions, contact your \\nlocal, state or federal employment service office. \\nVERBAL AND NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION \\nSmile when appropriate during the interview. Be enthusiastic and \\nresponsive. As you talk about your past and present activities, your \\npassion and energy can be communicated both through your words and \\nyour body language (an excited tone of voice, leaning forward, nodding \\nyour head in agreement). Maintaining eye contact is important; failure to \\ndo so may imply a lack of confidence or, worse, cause the employer to \\nquestion your truthfulness.'),\n",

By asking intelligent, \\nwell-thought-out questions that \\ngenuinely matter to you, you \\nwill convince the employer that \\nyou are serious about the \\norganization and the position. \\nAvoid asking questions \\nmentioned in the interview. \\n• What do you see as the \\npriorities for someone in \\nthis position?  \\n• Please describe a typical day \\non the job.  \\n• What training programs do \\nyou have available for your\\n \\nemployees?  \\n• What level of responsibility \\ncould I expect in this \\nposition?  \\n• What are the company\\'s \\nplans for the future?  \\n• What do you see as the \\ngreatest threat to the \\norganization?  \\n• What/where are the \\ngreatest opportunities for \\nthe organization?  \\n• How would you describe \\nyour organization\\'s \\nmanagement style, culture \\nor working environment?  \\n• What do you like most \\nabout your organization?  \\n• How are employees \\nevaluated and promoted?  \\n \\nSit comfortably, without slouching. Don\\'t put anything on your lap or in \\nyour hands if it will restrict your natural body movement or if you may be \\ntempted to play with it. Keep your clipboard, note pad, briefcase, or \\nportfolio on the floor beside your chair for easy retrieval.  \\nRespond to questions specifically and concisely but give sufficient details \\nto enable the interviewer to evaluate your credentials. Interviewers \\nbecome frustrated when they have to listen to long, rambling answers. \\nThink before you speak. It is quite acceptable to pause before talking in \\norder to organize your thoughts. Avoid verbal fillers such as \"um,\" \"ah,\" \\n\"you know,\" or regularly repeating the question to provide thinking time.  \\nUse business language. Avoid slang. Speak clearly. Watch the \\ninterviewer for clues on how the interview is progressing. Is the \\ninterviewer\\'s face or body language telling you that your answers are too \\nlong, not detailed enough, too boring? If in doubt, ask the interviewer if \\nmore or fewer details are needed.  \\nPrepare in advance to talk about any topic that you are concerned or feel \\nuncomfortable about. If there is something that you don’t want an \\ninterviewer to inquire about, it will likely be raised during the interview. \\nPractice your answer out loud often enough to feel confident. Maintain \\npoise and self-control. Consider a difficult issue as a learning opportunity \\nthat has made you a better person. \\nTYPES OF INTERVIEWS  \\nINDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS \\nThe most common interview format is one interviewer interviewing one \\ncandidate, either by phone, via video or in person.  \\nINTERVIEW WITH TWO OR MORE PEOPLE \\nIt is also common to be interviewed by a panel of people. Although it is \\nimportant to have good eye contact with the person who asks you a \\nquestion, also look at the other interviewers frequently to include them in \\nthe discussion. Try to remember each person\\'s name and use his or her \\nname during the interview. \\nGENERAL/GROUP INTERVIEW OR \\nINFORMATION SESSION  \\nThis approach is intended to provide applicants with a large amount of \\ninformation about the organization and the job. The format is used to \\nsave time and ensure that everyone understands the basic facts. This \\nprocess is usually followed by an individual interview. A well-timed and \\nintelligent question may help the employer remember you positively.'),\n",

This type of interview is sometimes used when a position \\ninvolves teamwork and the interviewers want to see how you interact in a \\ngroup setting, when the company wants to see who emerges as a leader \\nwithin the group, or when people are being interviewed for several similar \\nroles within the company. It is important to thoughtfully and intelligently \\ncontribute, be attentive to the contributions of others, and not to \\nmonopolize the conversation. \\nTELEPHONE INTERVIEW \\nTelephone interviews are an effective way to quickly and cost-effectively \\nscreen or hire candidates. If there will be more than one interview, the first \\nmay be conducted by phone. Candidates being seriously considered may be \\ninvited to a subsequent on-site interview.  \\nIf you are not ready for an interview when called, politely request that the \\ninterviewer call back at another, mutually convenient, time. This request will \\nallow you to refresh your memory on the organization and consider what \\npoints you want to make.  \\nAll of the advice about interview skills still applies. Your attire is your \\nchoice, but you may find that dressing professionally increases your \\nconfidence and allows you to perform better. Keep your resume, company \\nresearch, points that you want to highlight, and list of questions handy; in \\nfact, keep these in front of you during the interview for easy reference. \\n(Don\\'t shuffle your papers though!) Have a pen and paper available to note \\nany comments or questions that may occur to you during the interview.  \\nChoose your words carefully and be succinct. It is also important to vary \\nyour voice tone, tempo, and pitch to keep the employer\\'s attention. Ensure \\nthat you are in a private setting to eliminate distractions and background \\nnoise. \\nVIDEO CONFERENCING \\nIn this type of interview, recruiters use video technology to conduct \\ninterviews at a distance. Use the same strategies you would if you were \\nmeeting in person; clothing, body language, and dialogue are important. \\nDepending on the sophistication of the technology, you may experience \\nshort transmission delays.  \\nMake eye contact with the camera, which, to the employer, appears as \\ndirect \"eye contact.\" Remember to check the monitor periodically to \\nobserve the interviewer\\'s body language.  \\nIf speaking on camera makes you nervous, try to practice in front of a video \\ncamera or mirror before your interview.'),\n",

The visit can \\ntake from one hour to an entire day. One purpose is to allow you to meet \\nother staff. The second is to give more people an opportunity to interview \\nyou in greater depth to determine whether a good match is developing.  \\nDo not assume that a second interview will lead to a job offer; ensure you \\nactively listen, ask relevant questions, and collect specific information about \\nthe company so you can elaborate on how your strengths match the \\norganization's requirements. Use the opportunity to observe the work \\nenvironment (physical space, relations between employees, work pace) to \\ndetermine if the setting matches what you are seeking.  \\nAPPROACHES TO INTERVIEWING \\nStructured Interview \\nThe goal of this approach is to reduce bias and assist the employer in \\nmaking an objective decision. Typically, each candidate is asked the same \\nset of questions, responses are recorded, and ratings are assigned to each \\nresponse.  \\nUnstructured Interview \\nIn this format of interview, questions are based on the applicant's resume, \\nso different questions will be posed to each applicant. Without structured \\nguidelines, the conversation can be free flowing, thus making this method \\nof interviewing the most prone to bias. Although this type of interview may \\nseem more casual, you must still be well prepared and know the points \\nyou want to make. Be careful not to provide information you would not \\nhave communicated if the interview was more structured.  \\nEnding the Interview \\nWhen it appears that the interviewer is about to end the interview, you \\nshould make sure you have covered certain points before you leave the \\nroom. Make sure you understand the process that will occur before a \\ncandidate is selected for the job (another interview, meetings with other \\nindividuals in the organization, etc.). Ask the interviewer when you can \\nexpect to hear about a decision or ask when you should make an inquiry \\nas a follow-up. \\nEnthusiastically express your interest in the position (unless you are sure that \\nyou are not interested) and thank the interviewer for interviewing you. Ask \\nfor a business card or ensure that you have the interviewer's name, title, and \\naddress so that you can send a thank you letter. Mak\\ne sure your letter is sent \\nwithin 48 hours of the interview. In addition to being a standard business \\ncourtesy, a thank you letter may tip the scales in your favor if you are in close \\ncontention for the job.\"),\n",

The primary objectives are to:  \\n• Supplement resume information  \\n• Show that you understand your strengths and weaknesses and have a \\nsense of direction  \\n• Enable the employer to evaluate your personality and attitudes in \\nterms of the demands of the organization and the position  \\n• Allow you to gain information about the organization and the job \\nthat is not available through other sources  \\n• Give you and the employer an opportunity to discuss the desirability \\nof further contact or an offer of employment  \\nThe interview is a two-way process. You evaluate the employer while \\nhe/she evaluates you. Since there is no one way of interviewing, you will \\nhave to develop your own style. In order to present yourself well during \\nthe interview, you must be prepared. Preparation builds confidence and \\nenables you to give a better presentation of your qualifications. \\nINTERVIEW PREPARATION  \\nFirst Impressions \\nYour success or failure in an interview can depend on your appearance \\nand the interviewer\\'s first impression of you. Research indicates that, on \\naverage, an interviewer decides to hire in just 5½ minutes. If the first \\nimpression is not positive, it will be difficult to change the interviewer\\'s \\nmind during the rest of the interview.  \\nBe punctual. Arrive 10 minutes early to allow yourself time to collect \\nyour thoughts. Take the opportunity to observe the work environment. \\nKeep your eyes and ears open.  \\nLook professional—neat, clean, and well groomed. Select proper \\nclothing for the type of organization interviewing you. If in doubt, be \\nconservative. It is also advisable to keep fashion accessories to a \\nminimum, to avoid wearing strong scents, and to turn off devices such as \\ncell phones and electronic organizers. \\nGreet each person with respect and professionalism. When you shake \\nhands, make eye contact and smile. Handshakes should be firm but not \\naggressive; try to match the grip of the interviewer. It is good etiquette \\nto wait to sit down until the interviewer invites you to do so.  \\nKnow the Company/Organization \\nYou must be familiar with the position and the organization so that you \\ncan demonstrate your interest in and fit for the job. Refer to the \\nresearch notes you made as you reviewed print and online materials, \\nspoke with people about the position, and prepared your resume and \\ncover letter. \\n \\nINTERVIEW CHECKLIST: \\n• 5-10 copies of your resume \\n• A portfolio/notebook  \\n• Pen/pencil \\n• Questions for the interviewers \\n• Positive attitude \\n• Professionally dressed \\n \\nPROFESSIONAL ATTIRE: \\n• Solid color, conservative suit \\n• Coordinated blouse/shirt \\n• Minimal jewelry/accessories/tie \\n• Moderate shoes \\n• Neat, professional hairstyle \\n• Manicured nailsBEHAVIOR-BASED \\nQUESTIONS \\n• Describe a time when you \\nwere faced with problems or \\nstresses that tested your \\ncoping skills and how you \\nhandled it. \\n \\n• Describe a time when your \\nwork was harshly criticized. \\nHow did you react to this \\nfeedback? \\n \\n• Tell me about a time when a \\nproject really excited you. \\n \\n• Tell me about a situation \\nwhen you had absolutely no \\nidea how to approach a \\nproblem and how you \\neventually solved it. \\n \\n• Give me an example of a \\nsituation when your solution \\nto a problem did not help. \\nWhat was the outcome? \\n \\n• Describe the steps you \\nwould take if a customer \\ncame to you with a problem \\nthat was beyond your \\nresponsibilities but your \\nsupervisor was not available. \\n \\n• How would you handle a co-\\nworker who you notice \\nbeing rude to customers? \\n \\n• Tell me about a time when \\nyou had to adapt to people \\nfrom different cultures and \\nenvironments. \\n•  \\nCAR METHOD TO \\nANSWERING BEHAVIOR-\\nBASED QUESTIONS \\n• Use a three step process:      \\n1) context/situation 2) action \\n3) result or outcome.  \\n \\n \\n \\nA commonly asked interview question is: \"What do you know about our \\ncompany?\" If you are unable to answer this question effectively, \\nemployers will see this as a sign of lack of planning or interest. \\nResearch the Employer \\nThoroughly research the organization to impress those with whom you \\nmeet and discuss your alignment with the company.  \\nSuggested information to research: \\n• Key people in the organization \\n• Size of organization \\n• Location of facilities \\n• Structure of organization \\n• Types of clients \\n• Product line or service \\n• Potential markets \\n• Stock and assets information \\n• Competition \\n• Training provisions \\n• Recent news items \\n \\nYou can find this information in the following places: \\n• Employer brochures \\n• Public Relations \\n• Glassdoor.com \\n• Company website/Internet \\n• Other employees \\n \\nANSWERING INTERVIEW QUESTIONS \\nThe next phase of the interview consists of the interviewer asking you \\nquestions to try to determine your fit. Having knowledge of potential \\nquestions helps you to prepare points to include in your answers. Think \\nabout why a question is being asked. What does the employer really \\nwant to know? \\nBehavior-based and situational/hypothetical questions are increasing in \\npopularity because they are considered to be more valid predictors of \\non-the-job performance.  \\nBehavior-Based Questions \\nBehavior-based interviews are designed to elicit information about how \\nyou have performed in the past because past behavior is a good indicator \\nof how you will function in the future. Interviewers develop their \\nquestions around the traits and skills they consider necessary for \\nsucceeding in a position or organization.  \\nThese questions usually begin with phrases such as:  \\n• Tell me about a time...  \\n• Describe a situation in which...  \\n• Recall an instance when…  \\n• Give me an example of…  \\nSome applicants find the format of these questions difficult to understand \\nand have trouble responding. However, if you have done your research \\nand prepared for the interview, you will have work, academic, and life \\nexperiences ready to share. You can prepare for behavior-based \\nquestions by recalling specific actions that demonstrate your• Always cite a specific event and \\nbriefly fill the employer in on \\nthe situation.  \\n• Have a thorough \\nunderstanding of the \\nquestions.  \\n• Ask for clarification if \\nneeded. \\n• Deal with all questions \\npositively. \\n• Some questions give you the \\nchance to acknowledge your \\nfailures while showing how \\nyou have learned from them. \\n• Don\\'t be afraid to take a few \\nmoments to think about the \\nquestion--it\\'s better than \\nmaking something up! \\n \\nEXAMPLE \\n“Tell me about a time you had a \\ndifficult customer. How did you \\nhandle the situation?” \\n \\nWhen I was working at XYZ \\nCompany as an entry-level sales \\nassociate, a customer wanted to \\nreturn an item purchased over \\nnine months ago due to \\ndissatisfaction (Context). I \\ninformed the customer that the \\nproduct no longer met the \\ncompany’s return policy and the \\ncustomer became angry and \\ndemanded to speak with a \\nsupervisor.  I calmly let the \\ncustomer know that I would be \\nhappy to assist them in their \\nrequest and shared other \\nproducts as alternative solutions \\nas the customer waited for a \\nsupervisor (Action).  \\nEventually, the customer calmed \\ndown when I provided suitable \\nalternative options and even \\napologized for being rude to me \\nearlier (Results). \\n \\naccomplishments, abilities, and fit for the position. Be certain to tell the \\ntruth, get to the point, stay focused, turn negatives into positives, and be \\nconsistent with your responses.  \\nAnswering Behavior-Based Questions: W5 Model  \\nThe W5 model is a useful method for answering a behavior-based \\nquestion. The answer should take approximately 90 seconds (the length \\nof a typical attention span). \\n70 seconds - Identify the skill/knowledge/ability and give an example of \\nhow you applied or developed it by explaining:  \\n• What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How  \\n• What the successful outcome was  \\n20 seconds - Re-state the skill and outline the benefits transferable to \\nthe interviewer’s organization  \\nCOMMON BEHAVIOR-BASED INTERVIEW THEMES \\nINCLUDE:  \\n• Working effectively under pressure  \\n• Handling a difficult situation with a co-worker  \\n• Applying good judgment and logic in solving a problem  \\n• Completing a project on time  \\n• Persuading team members to do things your way  \\n• Writing a report or proposal that was well received  \\n• Anticipating potential problems and developing preventative \\nmeasures  \\n• Making an important decision with limited facts and information  \\n• Making a quick decision during the absence of a supervisor  \\n• Making an unpopular decision  \\n• Adapting to a difficult situation  \\n• Being tolerant of a different opinion  \\n• Dealing with an upset client or customer  \\n• Delegating a project effectively  \\n• Explaining complex information to a client, colleague or peer  \\nBy analyzing the questions asked of you, you will discover further details \\nabout the position. Does the interviewer seem to be emphasizing certain \\nskills, knowledge, personality traits, and attitudes? That insight can help you \\ntailor your answers more easily to the employer’s position. \\nFor example, in response to the query \"What experience do you have \\norganizing projects?\" you determine that the qualification being evaluated \\nis organizational skills. Your statement could be, \"I have developed \\nexcellent organizational skills by working on two major projects. The one \\nI would like to tell you about ended successfully six months ago.\"  \\nEvery statement you make must be true! Don’t lie or embellish. Ideally, \\nthe illustration you choose to confirm your statement should be a \\nproject that required similar competency to the typical project theprospective employer wants you to complete. If you do not have a \\nsimilar experience to relate, try to choose a relevant story from your \\nacademic, extracurricular, or volunteer activities.  \\nChoose words that will help the employer visualize you in the \\nexperience. Whenever possible, include positive feedback from \\nsupervisors, colleagues, professors, and others to reinforce your \\naccomplishment.  \\nThe next step is the one that most candidates forget. Tell the interviewer \\nwhat specific benefits or competitive advantage you can bring to the \\nposition because of the experience you have just described. For example, \\n\"As part of the team, I would be able to coordinate....\" Avoid generic \\nstatements such as \"All organizations need people with leadership ability.\"  \\nSituational/Hypothetical Questions  \\nAn interviewer will use situational/hypothetical questions to establish \\nhow you would react to and handle real-life situations on the job. For \\nsituational/hypothetical questions, candidates must have a good \\nunderstanding of the job and its requirements.  \\nHere are some examples of this type of question: \\n• If you had met your project deadlines and your direct supervisor was \\nunavailable, describe how you would remain busy.  \\n• You are the manager of a small marketing team, and one individual is \\ncontinually late for work and taking extended breaks. How would you \\napproach the issue?  \\n• During construction, a contractor unexpectedly finds a very large \\nobject in one of the trenches where he is about to dig. He requests \\nthat you tell him how to proceed. How would you deal with this \\nsituation?  \\n• You plan a workshop to teach newcomers to the country how to use \\nword processing software. Unfortunately, only four people have \\nregistered and you are required to have a class of ten. It is five days \\nbefore the class is scheduled to begin. What do you do?  \\n• You have a conflict with someone who is senior to you and is not \\nyour supervisor. Describe how you would handle it.  \\n \\nCLASSIC QUESTIONS \\nIn addition to asking the other \\ntypes of questions, many employers \\nrely on a series of standard \\nquestions, and you should prepare \\nfor them: \\n \\n• Tell me about yourself. \\n• What are your short-term \\ngoals? What about in two and \\nfive years? How are you \\npreparing to achieve them?  \\n• What is your vision or mission \\nstatement?  \\n• What do you think you will be \\nlooking for in the job following \\nthis position?  \\n• Why do you feel you will be \\nsuccessful in this work?  \\n• What other types of work are \\nyou looking for in addition to \\nthis role?  \\n• What supervisory or \\nleadership roles have you had?  \\n• For you, what are some \\nadvantages and disadvantages \\nof working in a team \\nenvironment?  \\n• What did you like/dislike about \\nyour last job?  \\n• What motivates you to do a \\ngood job?  \\n• What are your \\nstrengths/weaknesses?  \\n• What kinds of problems do \\nyou handle best?  \\n• How do you reduce stress and \\ntry to achieve balance in your \\nlife?  \\n• How did you handle a request \\nto do something contrary to \\nyour moral code or business \\nethics?  \\n• What do you know about us?HOW TO SHARE \\nYOUR STORY \\nIn an interview, you need at \\nleast five to eight stories that \\nhighlight skills, accomplishments, \\ncharacter traits, or passions. \\nPeople remember stories, and \\nyou want to be memorable. All \\nstories should have a purpose in \\ntelling them, either to highlight \\nsomething you did or to \\ndemonstrate you learned \\nsomething. All stories have a \\nbeginning, middle, and an end. \\nLeave one out and it\\'s not a \\nstory. \\nBEGINNING: Describe the \\nscene so the interviewer \\nunderstands the context. \\nMIDDLE: Next, identify what \\nYOU did to make this happen. \\nBe specific and make sure you \\nare teaching the person \\nsomething positive about you. \\nEND: Share the results of what \\nhappened. Even if it was not \\npositive, what did you learn \\nfrom it? Describe what you \\nwould do differently next time. \\n \\nANSWERING CLASSIC QUESTIONS- PAWS MODEL  \\nThe PAWS model is a useful method for answering classic questions \\nsuch as \"Tell me about yourself.\" The answer should take approximately \\n90 seconds (the length of a typical attention span). \\nWhen an employer asks this question, the employer is looking for those \\naspects of your life that are relevant to the job, such as how you became \\ninterested in the field, related experience, and courses taken. \\nThe \"PAWS\" acronym stands for Profile, Academic, Work, and Skills. \\nInclude all or as many of the four (in any order) to reinforce your fit for \\nthe job. As with any interview response, limit your answer to a \\nmaximum of ninety seconds. Here are some examples of what to discuss \\nin each of the four areas: \\nProfile: Mention how you became interested in this field and perhaps \\npoint out any relevant community involvement, extracurricular activities, \\nmemberships, and personal interests that further demonstrate your \\ncommitment to the field  \\nAcademic: Talk about your educational background \\n(degrees/diplomas/certifications) and other related training and \\nprofessional development initiatives/courses that you participated in  \\nWork: Highlight paid or unpaid experience related to the job  \\nSkills: Refer to specific technical skills that relate to the position or field \\n(programming C++, knowledge of GIS) and relevant transferable skills \\n(time management, problem-solving skills)TRICKY SITUATIONS \\nAwkward situations may occur \\nduring an interview, and it is up \\nto you to be prepared to \\nconfidently handle whatever \\nhappens. To increase your \\nconfidence and prepare for an \\ninterview, practice interviewing. \\nCheck for quality of information \\nin your answers, and the \\npositive, non-verbal \\nreinforcement of your words. \\nBy practicing responses out \\nloud, you can hear your \\nanswers and assess their \\neffectiveness; however, don\\'t \\npractice so much that you lose \\nyour spontaneity and your \\nanswers sound rehearsed. \\nThe key to tricky situations is \\nto remember that barriers to \\nemployment can often be \\novercome by focusing on the \\npositive. Circumstances that \\nyou may find problematic are: \\n1. Salary  \\n2. Silence  \\n3. Interviewer is an excessive \\ntalker  \\n4. Note-taking  \\n5. Being stumped  \\n6. Negative questions  \\n7. Many short-term jobs or \\ngaps in employment history  \\n8. Having never worked or no \\nrecent work experience  \\n9. Being over-/under-qualified  \\n10. Low grades  \\n11. Ageism  \\n12. Disclosure of disability  \\n13. Reasons for leaving last job  \\n14. Poor or no references  \\n15. Proprietary information  \\n \\nSALARY \\nIf applying for short-term work (such as co-op or summer positions), you \\nwill likely have only one interview, so it is acceptable to discuss salary. If \\nyou need to know the salary and it has not been discussed, ask about it as \\nyour final question. \\nEmployers hiring full-time or contract staff may inquire about salary \\nduring a first interview to see if your expectations are compatible with \\nwhat they are offering and to see how much value you place on your \\nexperience, skills, and educational background. Try to defer the subject \\nuntil you have been offered the job, but if the employer insists, be \\nprepared to offer a salary range that you know is realistic based on your \\nresearch.  \\nOver eighty percent of employers expect you to negotiate salary. \\nTherefore, it is appropriate to do your salary research and develop a \\nnegotiation strategy. Visit the Career Development Center to discuss \\nsalary negotiation techniques with a career counselor. \\nSILENCE \\nIf you answer a question and there is no prompt response or follow-up \\nquestion, what do you do? Try to remain calm and collected. Silence may \\nnot be a negative sign; the employer could be taking time to process and \\nrecord your answer or could be considering the next question. A few \\nemployers create periods of silence during an interview to see how \\ncandidates handle stressful and awkward situations.  \\nIn response to uncomfortable silence, ask the interviewers if they require \\nany further details regarding your last response, shifting the responsibility \\nto them. Resist the temptation to ramble because you may provide \\nirrelevant information that may hurt your chances of being offered the \\njob. \\nNOTE-TAKING \\nAlthough the interviewer will likely take notes, generally you should take \\nbasic notes. If you have your head down writing everything frantically, the \\nconversation will be uncomfortable and disengaged because of your lack \\nof eye contact and inability to show enthusiasm. \\nMaking brief notes is acceptable when you need to record information \\nthat may be easily forgotten, such as a key word, phone number or \\ncontact information. If you fear you may not recall other pertinent \\ndetails, document the information immediately after the interview.BEING STUMPED \\nTry not to focus on “what you \\nshould say.” Focus on the \\npurpose of this question. What \\ndo you think they want to know \\nabout you, based on the question \\nthey asked? They might be \\npurposely testing your ability to \\nsolve problems under pressure.  \\nProvide a response that \\ndemonstrates your process in \\nfinding a solution to a problem.  \\n \\nExample:  What is your \\nexperience with supervising \\nothers? \\n \\n• They might want to know \\nyour leadership style, or \\nhow you handle conflict \\nbetween co-workers. \\n \\n“I haven’t had the opportunity to \\nsupervise others yet.  However, I \\nled my senior capstone project in \\ndeveloping a business \\nplan…(provide detailed info on \\nhow you lead the team).” \\n \\n“In the past three years working \\nat XYZ Company, my leadership \\nresponsibilities have grown  from \\nbeing part of a project team to \\nspearheading a new \\nproject…(provide detail info on \\nhow you’ve increased your \\nleadership opportunity).” \\nBEING STUMPED \\nYou may have difficulty communicating your thoughts clearly and \\nconcisely, especially when you are not sure how to respond to a \\nquestion. The key is to remain calm and positive, focus on the question, \\nand continue to remind yourself that you are doing well. You may \\nrequest clarification if you are not sure what the interviewer is asking or \\npause and politely ask for a few moments to consider your response; \\nhowever, don\\'t take too much time because employers want to see that \\nyou can think well under pressure. \\nAfter a brief pause, if you still cannot respond to the interviewer\\'s \\nquestion, you may ask to defer your answer to the end of the interview. \\nThe risk is that interviews usually follow a certain structure and the \\nquestion might be missed entirely, leaving the interviewer with an \\nunanswered question. Of course, if you’re stumped because you simply \\ndo not know the answer, be honest with the interviewer in a positive \\nand professional manner. \\nWhen asked a question about a skill that you don\\'t have, demonstrate \\nthat you have the transferable skills necessary to succeed in the position. \\nFor example, \"I have excellent computer skills but I do not have \\nknowledge of that specific software. However, I did learn Dreamweaver, \\na similar program, on my own and quickly applied the concepts by \\nindependently creating a website for a project that received a grade of \\n90%.\" \\nNEGATIVE QUESTIONS \\nInterviewers will often ask negatively phrased questions to assess your \\nperceived weaknesses and strengths. The following are a few examples:  \\n• What are your weaknesses as an employee?  \\n• Recall a time from your work experience when you made a bad \\ndecision or mistake. How did you get beyond it?  \\n• Give me an example of a time you did not meet a project \\ndeadline. How did you handle the situation?  \\nBe honest and discuss a real work-related weakness or past event that \\nwould not negatively impact performance for the job you are applying \\nfor. Avoid the popular advice to turn a weakness into a strength (for \\nexample, \"I\\'m a perfectionist...\") because this kind of response is \\nunconvincing and over used. Be sure to end your \"weakness\" response \\non a positive note by indicating what steps you are taking to overcome \\nthe weakness. \\nIt is important to be as positive as possible, even when answering a \\nnegatively framed question, and to keep your answer short.GAPS IN EMPLOYMENT \\nEXPLANATIONS \\n \\n“While I was in between \\npositions, I volunteered at XYZ \\nCompany to improve my \\ncustomer service skills.” \\n“I utilized this gap in \\nemployment to help out my \\nfamily, which also gave me the \\nchance to improve my \\ncomputer and time management \\nskills.  I completed several self-\\nguided courses online through \\nLynda.com” \\n \\nMANY SHORT-TERM JOBS OR GAPS IN \\nEMPLOYMENT HISTORY  \\nIt is becoming more common to work for shorter periods for a variety of \\nemployers, so employers may not place as much emphasis on dates \\nworked as they might have in the past. However, if asked, be prepared to \\nprovide reasons that the employer will understand for your frequent job \\nchanges or gaps in employment history.  \\nGaps in your employment history can occur for many reasons, some \\nwithin and some beyond your control: short-term positions, lay-offs, \\nhealth or personal concerns, raising a family, extensive traveling, \\ncompleting a degree, unemployment, or time for career planning. In \\ncreating a targeted resume, you may also have chosen to omit some \\nexperiences. \\nAlthough you should truthfully explain in a few words the reasons for \\nyour job changes or gaps in employment, focus on what you did during \\nthe gaps that was related to the position. \\nHAVING NEVER WORKED OR NO RECENT \\nWORK EXPERIENCE  \\nTell the interviewer about any relevant courses, workshops, volunteer or \\ninternship experiences, and extracurricular activities. Indicate if you have \\nresearched and joined associations or societies in your field to learn or \\nstay knowledgeable about industry trends and connect with other \\nprofessionals. Convey your interest in the position and indicate that you \\nlook forward to a long-term association with the company. \\nBEING UNDER-/OVER-QUALIFIED \\nAlthough you may be concerned about your qualifications, the \\ninterviewer liked something about your resume or you wouldn’t have \\nbeen offered an interview! Counter the interviewer\\'s fear that you may \\nnot be suitable by emphasizing your positive traits and describing how \\nyour experience, education, and skills will help you succeed in the \\nposition. Demonstrate to the employer your commitment by describing \\nhow the position aligns with your career goals and how your decision to \\napply for the position was carefully planned.  \\nLOW GRADES \\nLow grades can stem from a lack of commitment (such as skipping classes \\nor excessive socializing), enrollment in an unsuitable program, or dealing \\nwith traumatic personal events. In any case, explain briefly and honestly \\nwhat happened and describe what steps you have taken to remedy the \\nsituation so that it is no longer an issue: \"I know my grades were less \\nthan stellar during my third year, but I really improved this term because I \\nattended a series of study skill workshops and they made a huge impact. I \\nnow know how to manage my time successfully, and I’m confident that I \\nwill perform well in this position.\"IF YOU HAVE POOR OR \\nNO REFERENCES: \\nIf you were unable to obtain a \\nreference from your previous \\nplace of employment because \\nyou left on bad terms, you must \\nbriefly explain why. Read the \\nsection on \"Reasons for Leaving \\nLast Job.\" \\nQuickly follow up your \\nstatement to suggest that the \\ninterviewer contact other \\nreferences from your list to \\nobtain a more accurate picture \\nof your previous work \\nexperiences. Stress how direct \\nmanagers, supervisors, teachers, \\nand colleagues enjoyed working \\nwith you and can attest to your \\nachievements and skills. \\nIf your references are outdated, \\nyou must decide if they are still \\nappropriate to use. If you feel \\nyour referees can still \\nsuccessfully highlight your skills, \\nfollow up with them to request \\ntheir permission to be \\ncontacted by potential \\nemployers. You will also want \\nto remind them of your \\nprevious accomplishments and \\nprovide them with an updated \\nresume. If you do not obtain \\ntheir permission, you must \\nobtain new references by \\nvolunteering, requesting client \\ntestimonials, etc. \\n \\nDISCLOSURE OF DISABILITY \\nPeople with physical, sensory or learning disabilities or chronic medical \\nconditions are advised, like all job seekers, to focus on their abilities and \\ninterests when choosing a career. \\nIt is important to be up front and honest about your situation if your \\ndisability may present a performance barrier or if you need to request \\naccommodation or assistive devices. If you determine that your disability \\ndoes not pose any risk to you or to fellow workers, you may choose to \\ndisclose your disability once a job offer is formally presented. It is not \\nnecessary to disclose your disability in your resume or cover letter, \\nalthough you may prefer to do so if the company you are applying to has \\na specific policy to hire people with disabilities or if you are applying to an \\nagency that deals with persons with disabilities. \\nEmployers may not understand what your disability involves and may feel \\nuncomfortable asking; the result is that they may perceive your disability \\nto be more of a barrier than it actually is. Determine how you can \\novercome or compensate for any perceived or real stumbling blocks to \\nemployment so that you can explain your situation more clearly and \\npositively. For example, you may say, \"Due to a spinal injury, I have no \\nsensation in my legs. I can get around and travel easily in my wheelchair. \\nMy injury does not affect how I think, solve problems, or communicate \\nand will not affect my performance on the job.\" You may also want to ask \\nif the employer has any additional questions. \\nSome regions offer assistance to help you secure employment. As well as \\noffering job placement programs, programs may provide you with \\nspecialized equipment, sign language interpreters, readers, and note \\ntakers to help you with job searching and interviewing. \\nREASONS FOR LEAVING LAST JOB \\nAn employer may inquire about your reasons for leaving a job to \\ndetermine if concerns from a previous job might impact the organization. \\nEmployers like to gauge your attitude toward work, management, \\norganizational change, and policies or guidelines. \\nBegin your response with a positive statement regarding your previous \\nplace of employment. Honestly and concisely state your reasons for \\nleaving. If you left on good terms, offer the interviewer letters of \\nreference that outline your relevant achievements. If the conditions under \\nwhich you left were negative, focus the interviewer’s attention on what \\nyou accomplished and avoid speaking negatively about past managers, \\ncolleagues or the organization. Emphasize that you will be able to handle \\nthe present job no matter what may have happened in the past.YOUR RIGHTS IN THE \\nINTERVIEW \\nThere are clear legal rights and \\nguidelines for employment \\ninterview questions. An \\napplicant for employment may \\nbe asked to divulge only \\ninformation relevant to the \\nposition applied for. By law, an \\nemployer must focus on \\ngathering information relevant \\nto deciding if an applicant can \\nperform the functions of a \\nposition. \\nSome employers mistakenly \\nbelieve that they have a right to \\nask any question they choose \\nsince they are paying the salary. \\nOthers are simply awkward in \\ntheir technique and an unlawful \\nquestion results. However, the \\nlaw does not distinguish \\nbetween the interviewer who is \\nasking questions with the intent \\nto discriminate and the one \\nwho is just curious or inept at \\ninterviewing. \\nSome questions are \\ninappropriate and others are \\nillegal. You do not have to \\nanswer questions that are illegal. \\nMost regions have laws that \\nprohibit discrimination in \\nemployment on the grounds of: \\n• Race  \\n• Ancestry  \\n• Place of origin  \\n• Ethnic origin  \\n• Citizenship  \\n• Religion  \\n• Gender  \\n• Age  \\n• Record of offences  \\n• Marital status  \\n• Family status  \\n• Disability  \\n• Medical history  \\n \\nPROPRIETARY INFORMATION \\nIf you are asked to provide confidential information about a past \\nemployer, it is best to refrain from giving any information that is not \\npublicly available. Revealing information about a past employer, who may \\nor may not be a competitor, could create a breach of confidentiality. \\nEven though you may have worked for this employer some time ago, you \\nare still obligated to keep confidential information private. The \\ninterviewer could be testing to see if you divulge any company \\ninformation because doing so may be an indicator that you will reveal \\nconfidential information about the interviewer\\'s company.  \\nIf your portfolio includes performance reviews or samples of written \\nwork, ensure that no proprietary information is included, such as the \\nnames of customers or clients.  \\nHANDLING ILLEGAL QUESTIONS \\nWhat should you do if you\\'re in the middle of an interview and have just \\nbeen asked what is clearly an illegal question? There is no clear-cut \\nanswer. Much depends on you. \\nIn some cases, you may be able to answer the \"hidden\" question. Think of \\nwhat information the employer is trying to elicit. For example, \"Do you \\nhave or plan to have children?\" may indicate a concern about an ability to \\nwork overtime or to travel. In this example, your answer should convey \\nyour willingness to maintain a flexible work schedule. You may elect to \\nsay \"Why do you ask?\" or \"Would you explain how this point is \\nconnected to the qualifications for this job?\" This could cause the \\nemployer to reconsider or clarify the question. It may offend some \\nemployers, but probably not the majority. \\nIf you feel that you should not answer the question (you shouldn\\'t have \\nto, after all) or that you are not interested in working for the company, \\nyou may state, \"I don\\'t feel obligated to answer personal questions \\nunrelated to the position\" or \"That question seems inappropriate for an \\ninterview.\" If you choose this option, you will either enlighten (the \\nemployer may not realize it is illegal and will be happy that you pointed it \\nout) or offend (the employer may not consider you for the position). \\nFor more information about illegal interview questions, contact your \\nlocal, state or federal employment service office. \\nVERBAL AND NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION \\nSmile when appropriate during the interview. Be enthusiastic and \\nresponsive. As you talk about your past and present activities, your \\npassion and energy can be communicated both through your words and \\nyour body language (an excited tone of voice, leaning forward, nodding \\nyour head in agreement). Maintaining eye contact is important; failure to \\ndo so may imply a lack of confidence or, worse, cause the employer to \\nquestion your truthfulness.QUESTIONS YOU \\nCAN ASK \\nYour questions should be \\npertinent to the position and \\nshow your enthusiasm and \\nknowledge. By asking intelligent, \\nwell-thought-out questions that \\ngenuinely matter to you, you \\nwill convince the employer that \\nyou are serious about the \\norganization and the position. \\nAvoid asking questions \\nmentioned in the interview. \\n• What do you see as the \\npriorities for someone in \\nthis position?  \\n• Please describe a typical day \\non the job.  \\n• What training programs do \\nyou have available for your\\n \\nemployees?  \\n• What level of responsibility \\ncould I expect in this \\nposition?  \\n• What are the company\\'s \\nplans for the future?  \\n• What do you see as the \\ngreatest threat to the \\norganization?  \\n• What/where are the \\ngreatest opportunities for \\nthe organization?  \\n• How would you describe \\nyour organization\\'s \\nmanagement style, culture \\nor working environment?  \\n• What do you like most \\nabout your organization?  \\n• How are employees \\nevaluated and promoted?  \\n \\nSit comfortably, without slouching. Don\\'t put anything on your lap or in \\nyour hands if it will restrict your natural body movement or if you may be \\ntempted to play with it. Keep your clipboard, note pad, briefcase, or \\nportfolio on the floor beside your chair for easy retrieval.  \\nRespond to questions specifically and concisely but give sufficient details \\nto enable the interviewer to evaluate your credentials. Interviewers \\nbecome frustrated when they have to listen to long, rambling answers. \\nThink before you speak. It is quite acceptable to pause before talking in \\norder to organize your thoughts. Avoid verbal fillers such as \"um,\" \"ah,\" \\n\"you know,\" or regularly repeating the question to provide thinking time.  \\nUse business language. Avoid slang. Speak clearly. Watch the \\ninterviewer for clues on how the interview is progressing. Is the \\ninterviewer\\'s face or body language telling you that your answers are too \\nlong, not detailed enough, too boring? If in doubt, ask the interviewer if \\nmore or fewer details are needed.  \\nPrepare in advance to talk about any topic that you are concerned or feel \\nuncomfortable about. If there is something that you don’t want an \\ninterviewer to inquire about, it will likely be raised during the interview. \\nPractice your answer out loud often enough to feel confident. Maintain \\npoise and self-control. Consider a difficult issue as a learning opportunity \\nthat has made you a better person. \\nTYPES OF INTERVIEWS  \\nINDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS \\nThe most common interview format is one interviewer interviewing one \\ncandidate, either by phone, via video or in person.  \\nINTERVIEW WITH TWO OR MORE PEOPLE \\nIt is also common to be interviewed by a panel of people. Although it is \\nimportant to have good eye contact with the person who asks you a \\nquestion, also look at the other interviewers frequently to include them in \\nthe discussion. Try to remember each person\\'s name and use his or her \\nname during the interview. \\nGENERAL/GROUP INTERVIEW OR \\nINFORMATION SESSION  \\nThis approach is intended to provide applicants with a large amount of \\ninformation about the organization and the job. The format is used to \\nsave time and ensure that everyone understands the basic facts. This \\nprocess is usually followed by an individual interview. A well-timed and \\nintelligent question may help the employer remember you positively.INTERVIEW RESOURCES \\n \\nVirtual Mock-Interviews on \\nDolphin CareerLink \\n• Practice a mock-interview \\nrecorded on Dolphin \\nCareerLink. \\n• The video can be utilized \\nfor your own purposes or \\nsent to others for review. \\n• You can request CDS staff \\nto review and provide \\nfeedback. \\n \\nMock-Interview during \\nDrop-In Career Counseling \\n• Practice a mock-interview \\nwith CDS staff on a first-\\ncome, first-served basis, \\nwithout an appointment. \\n• The mock-interview will last \\napproximately 15-20 \\nminutes. Then CDS staff \\nwill provide 10-15 minutes \\nof feedback and or \\nsuggestions. \\n• You will need to bring your \\nresume and a copy of the \\nposition description (job \\nposting).  \\n• Even if you are not applying \\nto a specific position, you \\nwill need to bring a sample \\nposition description to \\neffectively conduct a mock-\\ninterview. \\n \\nEmployer Interviews \\n• Each semester, CDS brings \\nvarious local employers on \\ncampus to provide mock-\\ninterviews for students. \\n• Employers will vary each \\nsemester. \\n• Students can register for \\nthis event on Dolphin \\nCareerLink under \\n“Workshops.” \\n• Please visit the CDS \\nwebsite to find out which \\nemployers will be on \\ncampus. \\nCOMPETITIVE GROUP INTERVIEW \\nIn this interview format, one or more people interview many candidates at \\nthe same time. This type of interview is sometimes used when a position \\ninvolves teamwork and the interviewers want to see how you interact in a \\ngroup setting, when the company wants to see who emerges as a leader \\nwithin the group, or when people are being interviewed for several similar \\nroles within the company. It is important to thoughtfully and intelligently \\ncontribute, be attentive to the contributions of others, and not to \\nmonopolize the conversation. \\nTELEPHONE INTERVIEW \\nTelephone interviews are an effective way to quickly and cost-effectively \\nscreen or hire candidates. If there will be more than one interview, the first \\nmay be conducted by phone. Candidates being seriously considered may be \\ninvited to a subsequent on-site interview.  \\nIf you are not ready for an interview when called, politely request that the \\ninterviewer call back at another, mutually convenient, time. This request will \\nallow you to refresh your memory on the organization and consider what \\npoints you want to make.  \\nAll of the advice about interview skills still applies. Your attire is your \\nchoice, but you may find that dressing professionally increases your \\nconfidence and allows you to perform better. Keep your resume, company \\nresearch, points that you want to highlight, and list of questions handy; in \\nfact, keep these in front of you during the interview for easy reference. \\n(Don\\'t shuffle your papers though!) Have a pen and paper available to note \\nany comments or questions that may occur to you during the interview.  \\nChoose your words carefully and be succinct. It is also important to vary \\nyour voice tone, tempo, and pitch to keep the employer\\'s attention. Ensure \\nthat you are in a private setting to eliminate distractions and background \\nnoise. \\nVIDEO CONFERENCING \\nIn this type of interview, recruiters use video technology to conduct \\ninterviews at a distance. Use the same strategies you would if you were \\nmeeting in person; clothing, body language, and dialogue are important. \\nDepending on the sophistication of the technology, you may experience \\nshort transmission delays.  \\nMake eye contact with the camera, which, to the employer, appears as \\ndirect \"eye contact.\" Remember to check the monitor periodically to \\nobserve the interviewer\\'s body language.  \\nIf speaking on camera makes you nervous, try to practice in front of a video \\ncamera or mirror before your interview.AFTER THE INTERVIEW \\n \\n• Send a thank you note \\nwithin 48 hours! Make sure \\nyou express your continued \\ninterest in the position. \\n• Follow-up with the \\nemployer regarding the \\nposition. One of the \\nquestions you should always \\nask at the end of an \\ninterview is “What is the \\nnext step in the hiring \\nprocess?” If you were given \\npermission during the \\ninterview to follow-up in \\ntwo weeks, you don’t have \\nto worry about contacting \\nthem too soon or too late. \\n• Conduct research on \\npotential salary offerings for \\nthe position. If you need \\nhelp with salary negotiating, \\nplease visit Career \\nDevelopment Services \\nduring Drop-In Career \\nCounseling after the \\ninterview ASAP. \\n \\n \\nSECOND INTERVIEW \\nWhen interviewing you for a long-term position, a prospective employer \\nmay invite you and other finalists to visit the organization. The visit can \\ntake from one hour to an entire day. One purpose is to allow you to meet \\nother staff. The second is to give more people an opportunity to interview \\nyou in greater depth to determine whether a good match is developing.  \\nDo not assume that a second interview will lead to a job offer; ensure you \\nactively listen, ask relevant questions, and collect specific information about \\nthe company so you can elaborate on how your strengths match the \\norganization\\'s requirements. Use the opportunity to observe the work \\nenvironment (physical space, relations between employees, work pace) to \\ndetermine if the setting matches what you are seeking.  \\nAPPROACHES TO INTERVIEWING \\nStructured Interview \\nThe goal of this approach is to reduce bias and assist the employer in \\nmaking an objective decision. Typically, each candidate is asked the same \\nset of questions, responses are recorded, and ratings are assigned to each \\nresponse.  \\nUnstructured Interview \\nIn this format of interview, questions are based on the applicant\\'s resume, \\nso different questions will be posed to each applicant. Without structured \\nguidelines, the conversation can be free flowing, thus making this method \\nof interviewing the most prone to bias. Although this type of interview may \\nseem more casual, you must still be well prepared and know the points \\nyou want to make. Be careful not to provide information you would not \\nhave communicated if the interview was more structured.  \\nEnding the Interview \\nWhen it appears that the interviewer is about to end the interview, you \\nshould make sure you have covered certain points before you leave the \\nroom. Make sure you understand the process that will occur before a \\ncandidate is selected for the job (another interview, meetings with other \\nindividuals in the organization, etc.). Ask the interviewer when you can \\nexpect to hear about a decision or ask when you should make an inquiry \\nas a follow-up. \\nEnthusiastically express your interest in the position (unless you are sure that \\nyou are not interested) and thank the interviewer for interviewing you. Ask \\nfor a business card or ensure that you have the interviewer\\'s name, title, and \\naddress so that you can send a thank you letter. Mak\\ne sure your letter is sent \\nwithin 48 hours of the interview. In addition to being a standard business \\ncourtesy, a thank you letter may tip the scales in your favor if you are in close \\ncontention for the job.Interview Evaluation \\nIf you do not receive a job offer and you felt that the fit was very good, \\nconsider contacting the interviewer for feedback on your performance. Did \\nthe interviewer hire someone better qualified for the position? If so, what \\nadditional qualifications might you need to be hired for a similar position? \\nDid you adequately present your qualifications? If not, stay motivated but \\nlearn from any feedback and make necessary changes for your next \\ninterview. \\nCONTACT INFORMATION \\nCAREER DEVELOPMENT SERVICES \\n \\n \\nOne University Drive, Bell Tower 1548 \\n(805) 437-3270 (office) \\n(805) 437-8899 (fax) \\ncareer.services@csuci.edu \\nFor further assistance please visit us during  \\nDrop-In Career Counseling.'"

              "['INTERVIEW HANDBOOK \\n \\n \\n \\nCareer Development Services \\n805.437.3270 \\ncareer.services@csuci.edu \\nwww.csuci.edu/careerdevelopment/THE PURPOSE OF AN INTERVIEW \\nAn interview is a mutual exchange of information between an employer \\nand you, as a candidate for a position. The primary objectives are to:  \\n• Supplement resume information  \\n• Show that you understand your strengths and weaknesses and have a \\nsense of direction  \\n• Enable the employer to evaluate your personality and attitudes in \\nterms of the demands of the organization and the position  \\n• Allow you to gain information about the organization and the job \\nthat is not available through other sources  \\n• Give you and the employer an opportunity to discuss the desirability \\nof further contact or an offer of employment  \\nThe interview is a two-way process. You evaluate the employer while \\nhe/she evaluates you. Since there is no one way of interviewing, you will \\nhave to develop your own style. In order to present yourself well during \\nthe interview, you must be prepared. Preparation builds confidence and \\nenables you to give a better presentation of your qualifications. \\nINTERVIEW PREPARATION  \\nFirst Impressions \\nYour success or failure in an interview can depend on your appearance \\nand the interviewer\\'s first impression of you. Research indicates that, on \\naverage, an interviewer decides to hire in just 5½ minutes. If the first \\nimpression is not positive, it will be difficult to change the interviewer\\'s \\nmind during the rest of the interview.  \\nBe punctual. Arrive 10 minutes early to allow yourself time to collect \\nyour thoughts. Take the opportunity to observe the work environment. \\nKeep your eyes and ears open.  \\nLook professional—neat, clean, and well groomed. Select proper \\nclothing for the type of organization interviewing you. If in doubt, be \\nconservative. It is also advisable to keep fashion accessories to a \\nminimum, to avoid wearing strong scents, and to turn off devices such as \\ncell phones and electronic organizers. \\nGreet each person with respect and professionalism. When you shake \\nhands, make eye contact and smile. Handshakes should be firm but not \\naggressive; try to match the grip of the interviewer. It is good etiquette \\nto wait to sit down until the interviewer invites you to do so.  \\nKnow the Company/Organization \\nYou must be familiar with the position and the organization so that you \\ncan demonstrate your interest in and fit for the job. Refer to the \\nresearch notes you made as you reviewed print and online materials, \\nspoke with people about the position, and prepared your resume and \\ncover letter. \\n \\nINTERVIEW CHECKLIST: \\n• 5-10 copies of your resume \\n• A portfolio/notebook  \\n• Pen/pencil \\n• Questions for the interviewers \\n• Positive attitude \\n• Professionally dressed \\n \\nPROFESSIONAL ATTIRE: \\n• Solid color, conservative suit \\n• Coordinated blouse/shirt \\n• Minimal jewelry/accessories/tie \\n• Moderate shoes \\n• Neat, professional hairstyle \\n• Manicured nailsBEHAVIOR-BASED \\nQUESTIONS \\n• Describe a time when you \\nwere faced with problems or \\nstresses that tested your \\ncoping skills and how you \\nhandled it. \\n \\n• Describe a time when your \\nwork was harshly criticized. \\nHow did you react to this \\nfeedback? \\n \\n• Tell me about a time when a \\nproject really excited you. \\n \\n• Tell me about a situation \\nwhen you had absolutely no \\nidea how to approach a \\nproblem and how you \\neventually solved it. \\n \\n• Give me an example of a \\nsituation when your solution \\nto a problem did not help. \\nWhat was the outcome? \\n \\n• Describe the steps you \\nwould take if a customer \\ncame to you with a problem \\nthat was beyond your \\nresponsibilities but your \\nsupervisor was not available. \\n \\n• How would you handle a co-\\nworker who you notice \\nbeing rude to customers? \\n \\n• Tell me about a time when \\nyou had to adapt to people \\nfrom different cultures and \\nenvironments. \\n•  \\nCAR METHOD TO \\nANSWERING BEHAVIOR-\\nBASED QUESTIONS \\n• Use a three step process:      \\n1) context/situation 2) action \\n3) result or outcome.  \\n \\n \\n \\nA commonly asked interview question is: \"What do you know about our \\ncompany?\" If you are unable to answer this question effectively, \\nemployers will see this as a sign of lack of planning or interest. \\nResearch the Employer \\nThoroughly research the organization to impress those with whom you \\nmeet and discuss your alignment with the company.  \\nSuggested information to research: \\n• Key people in the organization \\n• Size of organization \\n• Location of facilities \\n• Structure of organization \\n• Types of clients \\n• Product line or service \\n• Potential markets \\n• Stock and assets information \\n• Competition \\n• Training provisions \\n• Recent news items \\n \\nYou can find this information in the following places: \\n• Employer brochures \\n• Public Relations \\n• Glassdoor.com \\n• Company website/Internet \\n• Other employees \\n \\nANSWERING INTERVIEW QUESTIONS \\nThe next phase of the interview consists of the interviewer asking you \\nquestions to try to determine your fit. Having knowledge of potential \\nquestions helps you to prepare points to include in your answers. Think \\nabout why a question is being asked. What does the employer really \\nwant to know? \\nBehavior-based and situational/hypothetical questions are increasing in \\npopularity because they are considered to be more valid predictors of \\non-the-job performance.  \\nBehavior-Based Questions \\nBehavior-based interviews are designed to elicit information about how \\nyou have performed in the past because past behavior is a good indicator \\nof how you will function in the future. Interviewers develop their \\nquestions around the traits and skills they consider necessary for \\nsucceeding in a position or organization.  \\nThese questions usually begin with phrases such as:  \\n• Tell me about a time...  \\n• Describe a situation in which...  \\n• Recall an instance when…  \\n• Give me an example of…  \\nSome applicants find the format of these questions difficult to understand \\nand have trouble responding. However, if you have done your research \\nand prepared for the interview, you will have work, academic, and life \\nexperiences ready to share. You can prepare for behavior-based \\nquestions by recalling specific actions that demonstrate your• Always cite a specific event and \\nbriefly fill the employer in on \\nthe situation.  \\n• Have a thorough \\nunderstanding of the \\nquestions.  \\n• Ask for clarification if \\nneeded. \\n• Deal with all questions \\npositively. \\n• Some questions give you the \\nchance to acknowledge your \\nfailures while showing how \\nyou have learned from them. \\n• Don\\'t be afraid to take a few \\nmoments to think about the \\nquestion--it\\'s better than \\nmaking something up! \\n \\nEXAMPLE \\n“Tell me about a time you had a \\ndifficult customer. How did you \\nhandle the situation?” \\n \\nWhen I was working at XYZ \\nCompany as an entry-level sales \\nassociate, a customer wanted to \\nreturn an item purchased over \\nnine months ago due to \\ndissatisfaction (Context). I \\ninformed the customer that the \\nproduct no longer met the \\ncompany’s return policy and the \\ncustomer became angry and \\ndemanded to speak with a \\nsupervisor.  I calmly let the \\ncustomer know that I would be \\nhappy to assist them in their \\nrequest and shared other \\nproducts as alternative solutions \\nas the customer waited for a \\nsupervisor (Action).  \\nEventually, the customer calmed \\ndown when I provided suitable \\nalternative options and even \\napologized for being rude to me \\nearlier (Results). \\n \\naccomplishments, abilities, and fit for the position. Be certain to tell the \\ntruth, get to the point, stay focused, turn negatives into positives, and be \\nconsistent with your responses.  \\nAnswering Behavior-Based Questions: W5 Model  \\nThe W5 model is a useful method for answering a behavior-based \\nquestion. The answer should take approximately 90 seconds (the length \\nof a typical attention span). \\n70 seconds - Identify the skill/knowledge/ability and give an example of \\nhow you applied or developed it by explaining:  \\n• What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How  \\n• What the successful outcome was  \\n20 seconds - Re-state the skill and outline the benefits transferable to \\nthe interviewer’s organization  \\nCOMMON BEHAVIOR-BASED INTERVIEW THEMES \\nINCLUDE:  \\n• Working effectively under pressure  \\n• Handling a difficult situation with a co-worker  \\n• Applying good judgment and logic in solving a problem  \\n• Completing a project on time  \\n• Persuading team members to do things your way  \\n• Writing a report or proposal that was well received  \\n• Anticipating potential problems and developing preventative \\nmeasures  \\n• Making an important decision with limited facts and information  \\n• Making a quick decision during the absence of a supervisor  \\n• Making an unpopular decision  \\n• Adapting to a difficult situation  \\n• Being tolerant of a different opinion  \\n• Dealing with an upset client or customer  \\n• Delegating a project effectively  \\n• Explaining complex information to a client, colleague or peer  \\nBy analyzing the questions asked of you, you will discover further details \\nabout the position. Does the interviewer seem to be emphasizing certain \\nskills, knowledge, personality traits, and attitudes? That insight can help you \\ntailor your answers more easily to the employer’s position. \\nFor example, in response to the query \"What experience do you have \\norganizing projects?\" you determine that the qualification being evaluated \\nis organizational skills. Your statement could be, \"I have developed \\nexcellent organizational skills by working on two major projects. The one \\nI would like to tell you about ended successfully six months ago.\"  \\nEvery statement you make must be true! Don’t lie or embellish. Ideally, \\nthe illustration you choose to confirm your statement should be a \\nproject that required similar competency to the typical project theprospective employer wants you to complete. If you do not have a \\nsimilar experience to relate, try to choose a relevant story from your \\nacademic, extracurricular, or volunteer activities.  \\nChoose words that will help the employer visualize you in the \\nexperience. Whenever possible, include positive feedback from \\nsupervisors, colleagues, professors, and others to reinforce your \\naccomplishment.  \\nThe next step is the one that most candidates forget. Tell the interviewer \\nwhat specific benefits or competitive advantage you can bring to the \\nposition because of the experience you have just described. For example, \\n\"As part of the team, I would be able to coordinate....\" Avoid generic \\nstatements such as \"All organizations need people with leadership ability.\"  \\nSituational/Hypothetical Questions  \\nAn interviewer will use situational/hypothetical questions to establish \\nhow you would react to and handle real-life situations on the job. For \\nsituational/hypothetical questions, candidates must have a good \\nunderstanding of the job and its requirements.  \\nHere are some examples of this type of question: \\n• If you had met your project deadlines and your direct supervisor was \\nunavailable, describe how you would remain busy.  \\n• You are the manager of a small marketing team, and one individual is \\ncontinually late for work and taking extended breaks. How would you \\napproach the issue?  \\n• During construction, a contractor unexpectedly finds a very large \\nobject in one of the trenches where he is about to dig. He requests \\nthat you tell him how to proceed. How would you deal with this \\nsituation?  \\n• You plan a workshop to teach newcomers to the country how to use \\nword processing software. Unfortunately, only four people have \\nregistered and you are required to have a class of ten. It is five days \\nbefore the class is scheduled to begin. What do you do?  \\n• You have a conflict with someone who is senior to you and is not \\nyour supervisor. Describe how you would handle it.  \\n \\nCLASSIC QUESTIONS \\nIn addition to asking the other \\ntypes of questions, many employers \\nrely on a series of standard \\nquestions, and you should prepare \\nfor them: \\n \\n• Tell me about yourself. \\n• What are your short-term \\ngoals? What about in two and \\nfive years? How are you \\npreparing to achieve them?  \\n• What is your vision or mission \\nstatement?  \\n• What do you think you will be \\nlooking for in the job following \\nthis position?  \\n• Why do you feel you will be \\nsuccessful in this work?  \\n• What other types of work are \\nyou looking for in addition to \\nthis role?  \\n• What supervisory or \\nleadership roles have you had?  \\n• For you, what are some \\nadvantages and disadvantages \\nof working in a team \\nenvironment?  \\n• What did you like/dislike about \\nyour last job?  \\n• What motivates you to do a \\ngood job?  \\n• What are your \\nstrengths/weaknesses?  \\n• What kinds of problems do \\nyou handle best?  \\n• How do you reduce stress and \\ntry to achieve balance in your \\nlife?  \\n• How did you handle a request \\nto do something contrary to \\nyour moral code or business \\nethics?  \\n• What do you know about us?HOW TO SHARE \\nYOUR STORY \\nIn an interview, you need at \\nleast five to eight stories that \\nhighlight skills, accomplishments, \\ncharacter traits, or passions. \\nPeople remember stories, and \\nyou want to be memorable. All \\nstories should have a purpose in \\ntelling them, either to highlight \\nsomething you did or to \\ndemonstrate you learned \\nsomething. All stories have a \\nbeginning, middle, and an end. \\nLeave one out and it\\'s not a \\nstory. \\nBEGINNING: Describe the \\nscene so the interviewer \\nunderstands the context. \\nMIDDLE: Next, identify what \\nYOU did to make this happen. \\nBe specific and make sure you \\nare teaching the person \\nsomething positive about you. \\nEND: Share the results of what \\nhappened. Even if it was not \\npositive, what did you learn \\nfrom it? Describe what you \\nwould do differently next time. \\n \\nANSWERING CLASSIC QUESTIONS- PAWS MODEL  \\nThe PAWS model is a useful method for answering classic questions \\nsuch as \"Tell me about yourself.\" The answer should take approximately \\n90 seconds (the length of a typical attention span). \\nWhen an employer asks this question, the employer is looking for those \\naspects of your life that are relevant to the job, such as how you became \\ninterested in the field, related experience, and courses taken. \\nThe \"PAWS\" acronym stands for Profile, Academic, Work, and Skills. \\nInclude all or as many of the four (in any order) to reinforce your fit for \\nthe job. As with any interview response, limit your answer to a \\nmaximum of ninety seconds. Here are some examples of what to discuss \\nin each of the four areas: \\nProfile: Mention how you became interested in this field and perhaps \\npoint out any relevant community involvement, extracurricular activities, \\nmemberships, and personal interests that further demonstrate your \\ncommitment to the field  \\nAcademic: Talk about your educational background \\n(degrees/diplomas/certifications) and other related training and \\nprofessional development initiatives/courses that you participated in  \\nWork: Highlight paid or unpaid experience related to the job  \\nSkills: Refer to specific technical skills that relate to the position or field \\n(programming C++, knowledge of GIS) and relevant transferable skills \\n(time management, problem-solving skills)TRICKY SITUATIONS \\nAwkward situations may occur \\nduring an interview, and it is up \\nto you to be prepared to \\nconfidently handle whatever \\nhappens. To increase your \\nconfidence and prepare for an \\ninterview, practice interviewing. \\nCheck for quality of information \\nin your answers, and the \\npositive, non-verbal \\nreinforcement of your words. \\nBy practicing responses out \\nloud, you can hear your \\nanswers and assess their \\neffectiveness; however, don\\'t \\npractice so much that you lose \\nyour spontaneity and your \\nanswers sound rehearsed. \\nThe key to tricky situations is \\nto remember that barriers to \\nemployment can often be \\novercome by focusing on the \\npositive. Circumstances that \\nyou may find problematic are: \\n1. Salary  \\n2. Silence  \\n3. Interviewer is an excessive \\ntalker  \\n4. Note-taking  \\n5. Being stumped  \\n6. Negative questions  \\n7. Many short-term jobs or \\ngaps in employment history  \\n8. Having never worked or no \\nrecent work experience  \\n9. Being over-/under-qualified  \\n10. Low grades  \\n11. Ageism  \\n12. Disclosure of disability  \\n13. Reasons for leaving last job  \\n14. Poor or no references  \\n15. Proprietary information  \\n \\nSALARY \\nIf applying for short-term work (such as co-op or summer positions), you \\nwill likely have only one interview, so it is acceptable to discuss salary. If \\nyou need to know the salary and it has not been discussed, ask about it as \\nyour final question. \\nEmployers hiring full-time or contract staff may inquire about salary \\nduring a first interview to see if your expectations are compatible with \\nwhat they are offering and to see how much value you place on your \\nexperience, skills, and educational background. Try to defer the subject \\nuntil you have been offered the job, but if the employer insists, be \\nprepared to offer a salary range that you know is realistic based on your \\nresearch.  \\nOver eighty percent of employers expect you to negotiate salary. \\nTherefore, it is appropriate to do your salary research and develop a \\nnegotiation strategy. Visit the Career Development Center to discuss \\nsalary negotiation techniques with a career counselor. \\nSILENCE \\nIf you answer a question and there is no prompt response or follow-up \\nquestion, what do you do? Try to remain calm and collected. Silence may \\nnot be a negative sign; the employer could be taking time to process and \\nrecord your answer or could be considering the next question. A few \\nemployers create periods of silence during an interview to see how \\ncandidates handle stressful and awkward situations.  \\nIn response to uncomfortable silence, ask the interviewers if they require \\nany further details regarding your last response, shifting the responsibility \\nto them. Resist the temptation to ramble because you may provide \\nirrelevant information that may hurt your chances of being offered the \\njob. \\nNOTE-TAKING \\nAlthough the interviewer will likely take notes, generally you should take \\nbasic notes. If you have your head down writing everything frantically, the \\nconversation will be uncomfortable and disengaged because of your lack \\nof eye contact and inability to show enthusiasm. \\nMaking brief notes is acceptable when you need to record information \\nthat may be easily forgotten, such as a key word, phone number or \\ncontact information. If you fear you may not recall other pertinent \\ndetails, document the information immediately after the interview.BEING STUMPED \\nTry not to focus on “what you \\nshould say.” Focus on the \\npurpose of this question. What \\ndo you think they want to know \\nabout you, based on the question \\nthey asked? They might be \\npurposely testing your ability to \\nsolve problems under pressure.  \\nProvide a response that \\ndemonstrates your process in \\nfinding a solution to a problem.  \\n \\nExample:  What is your \\nexperience with supervising \\nothers? \\n \\n• They might want to know \\nyour leadership style, or \\nhow you handle conflict \\nbetween co-workers. \\n \\n“I haven’t had the opportunity to \\nsupervise others yet.  However, I \\nled my senior capstone project in \\ndeveloping a business \\nplan…(provide detailed info on \\nhow you lead the team).” \\n \\n“In the past three years working \\nat XYZ Company, my leadership \\nresponsibilities have grown  from \\nbeing part of a project team to \\nspearheading a new \\nproject…(provide detail info on \\nhow you’ve increased your \\nleadership opportunity).” \\nBEING STUMPED \\nYou may have difficulty communicating your thoughts clearly and \\nconcisely, especially when you are not sure how to respond to a \\nquestion. The key is to remain calm and positive, focus on the question, \\nand continue to remind yourself that you are doing well. You may \\nrequest clarification if you are not sure what the interviewer is asking or \\npause and politely ask for a few moments to consider your response; \\nhowever, don\\'t take too much time because employers want to see that \\nyou can think well under pressure. \\nAfter a brief pause, if you still cannot respond to the interviewer\\'s \\nquestion, you may ask to defer your answer to the end of the interview. \\nThe risk is that interviews usually follow a certain structure and the \\nquestion might be missed entirely, leaving the interviewer with an \\nunanswered question. Of course, if you’re stumped because you simply \\ndo not know the answer, be honest with the interviewer in a positive \\nand professional manner. \\nWhen asked a question about a skill that you don\\'t have, demonstrate \\nthat you have the transferable skills necessary to succeed in the position. \\nFor example, \"I have excellent computer skills but I do not have \\nknowledge of that specific software. However, I did learn Dreamweaver, \\na similar program, on my own and quickly applied the concepts by \\nindependently creating a website for a project that received a grade of \\n90%.\" \\nNEGATIVE QUESTIONS \\nInterviewers will often ask negatively phrased questions to assess your \\nperceived weaknesses and strengths. The following are a few examples:  \\n• What are your weaknesses as an employee?  \\n• Recall a time from your work experience when you made a bad \\ndecision or mistake. How did you get beyond it?  \\n• Give me an example of a time you did not meet a project \\ndeadline. How did you handle the situation?  \\nBe honest and discuss a real work-related weakness or past event that \\nwould not negatively impact performance for the job you are applying \\nfor. Avoid the popular advice to turn a weakness into a strength (for \\nexample, \"I\\'m a perfectionist...\") because this kind of response is \\nunconvincing and over used. Be sure to end your \"weakness\" response \\non a positive note by indicating what steps you are taking to overcome \\nthe weakness. \\nIt is important to be as positive as possible, even when answering a \\nnegatively framed question, and to keep your answer short.GAPS IN EMPLOYMENT \\nEXPLANATIONS \\n \\n“While I was in between \\npositions, I volunteered at XYZ \\nCompany to improve my \\ncustomer service skills.” \\n“I utilized this gap in \\nemployment to help out my \\nfamily, which also gave me the \\nchance to improve my \\ncomputer and time management \\nskills.  I completed several self-\\nguided courses online through \\nLynda.com” \\n \\nMANY SHORT-TERM JOBS OR GAPS IN \\nEMPLOYMENT HISTORY  \\nIt is becoming more common to work for shorter periods for a variety of \\nemployers, so employers may not place as much emphasis on dates \\nworked as they might have in the past. However, if asked, be prepared to \\nprovide reasons that the employer will understand for your frequent job \\nchanges or gaps in employment history.  \\nGaps in your employment history can occur for many reasons, some \\nwithin and some beyond your control: short-term positions, lay-offs, \\nhealth or personal concerns, raising a family, extensive traveling, \\ncompleting a degree, unemployment, or time for career planning. In \\ncreating a targeted resume, you may also have chosen to omit some \\nexperiences. \\nAlthough you should truthfully explain in a few words the reasons for \\nyour job changes or gaps in employment, focus on what you did during \\nthe gaps that was related to the position. \\nHAVING NEVER WORKED OR NO RECENT \\nWORK EXPERIENCE  \\nTell the interviewer about any relevant courses, workshops, volunteer or \\ninternship experiences, and extracurricular activities. Indicate if you have \\nresearched and joined associations or societies in your field to learn or \\nstay knowledgeable about industry trends and connect with other \\nprofessionals. Convey your interest in the position and indicate that you \\nlook forward to a long-term association with the company. \\nBEING UNDER-/OVER-QUALIFIED \\nAlthough you may be concerned about your qualifications, the \\ninterviewer liked something about your resume or you wouldn’t have \\nbeen offered an interview! Counter the interviewer\\'s fear that you may \\nnot be suitable by emphasizing your positive traits and describing how \\nyour experience, education, and skills will help you succeed in the \\nposition. Demonstrate to the employer your commitment by describing \\nhow the position aligns with your career goals and how your decision to \\napply for the position was carefully planned.  \\nLOW GRADES \\nLow grades can stem from a lack of commitment (such as skipping classes \\nor excessive socializing), enrollment in an unsuitable program, or dealing \\nwith traumatic personal events. In any case, explain briefly and honestly \\nwhat happened and describe what steps you have taken to remedy the \\nsituation so that it is no longer an issue: \"I know my grades were less \\nthan stellar during my third year, but I really improved this term because I \\nattended a series of study skill workshops and they made a huge impact. I \\nnow know how to manage my time successfully, and I’m confident that I \\nwill perform well in this position.\"IF YOU HAVE POOR OR \\nNO REFERENCES: \\nIf you were unable to obtain a \\nreference from your previous \\nplace of employment because \\nyou left on bad terms, you must \\nbriefly explain why. Read the \\nsection on \"Reasons for Leaving \\nLast Job.\" \\nQuickly follow up your \\nstatement to suggest that the \\ninterviewer contact other \\nreferences from your list to \\nobtain a more accurate picture \\nof your previous work \\nexperiences. Stress how direct \\nmanagers, supervisors, teachers, \\nand colleagues enjoyed working \\nwith you and can attest to your \\nachievements and skills. \\nIf your references are outdated, \\nyou must decide if they are still \\nappropriate to use. If you feel \\nyour referees can still \\nsuccessfully highlight your skills, \\nfollow up with them to request \\ntheir permission to be \\ncontacted by potential \\nemployers. You will also want \\nto remind them of your \\nprevious accomplishments and \\nprovide them with an updated \\nresume. If you do not obtain \\ntheir permission, you must \\nobtain new references by \\nvolunteering, requesting client \\ntestimonials, etc. \\n \\nDISCLOSURE OF DISABILITY \\nPeople with physical, sensory or learning disabilities or chronic medical \\nconditions are advised, like all job seekers, to focus on their abilities and \\ninterests when choosing a career. \\nIt is important to be up front and honest about your situation if your \\ndisability may present a performance barrier or if you need to request \\naccommodation or assistive devices. If you determine that your disability \\ndoes not pose any risk to you or to fellow workers, you may choose to \\ndisclose your disability once a job offer is formally presented. It is not \\nnecessary to disclose your disability in your resume or cover letter, \\nalthough you may prefer to do so if the company you are applying to has \\na specific policy to hire people with disabilities or if you are applying to an \\nagency that deals with persons with disabilities. \\nEmployers may not understand what your disability involves and may feel \\nuncomfortable asking; the result is that they may perceive your disability \\nto be more of a barrier than it actually is. Determine how you can \\novercome or compensate for any perceived or real stumbling blocks to \\nemployment so that you can explain your situation more clearly and \\npositively. For example, you may say, \"Due to a spinal injury, I have no \\nsensation in my legs. I can get around and travel easily in my wheelchair. \\nMy injury does not affect how I think, solve problems, or communicate \\nand will not affect my performance on the job.\" You may also want to ask \\nif the employer has any additional questions. \\nSome regions offer assistance to help you secure employment. As well as \\noffering job placement programs, programs may provide you with \\nspecialized equipment, sign language interpreters, readers, and note \\ntakers to help you with job searching and interviewing. \\nREASONS FOR LEAVING LAST JOB \\nAn employer may inquire about your reasons for leaving a job to \\ndetermine if concerns from a previous job might impact the organization. \\nEmployers like to gauge your attitude toward work, management, \\norganizational change, and policies or guidelines. \\nBegin your response with a positive statement regarding your previous \\nplace of employment. Honestly and concisely state your reasons for \\nleaving. If you left on good terms, offer the interviewer letters of \\nreference that outline your relevant achievements. If the conditions under \\nwhich you left were negative, focus the interviewer’s attention on what \\nyou accomplished and avoid speaking negatively about past managers, \\ncolleagues or the organization. Emphasize that you will be able to handle \\nthe present job no matter what may have happened in the past.YOUR RIGHTS IN THE \\nINTERVIEW \\nThere are clear legal rights and \\nguidelines for employment \\ninterview questions. An \\napplicant for employment may \\nbe asked to divulge only \\ninformation relevant to the \\nposition applied for. By law, an \\nemployer must focus on \\ngathering information relevant \\nto deciding if an applicant can \\nperform the functions of a \\nposition. \\nSome employers mistakenly \\nbelieve that they have a right to \\nask any question they choose \\nsince they are paying the salary. \\nOthers are simply awkward in \\ntheir technique and an unlawful \\nquestion results. However, the \\nlaw does not distinguish \\nbetween the interviewer who is \\nasking questions with the intent \\nto discriminate and the one \\nwho is just curious or inept at \\ninterviewing. \\nSome questions are \\ninappropriate and others are \\nillegal. You do not have to \\nanswer questions that are illegal. \\nMost regions have laws that \\nprohibit discrimination in \\nemployment on the grounds of: \\n• Race  \\n• Ancestry  \\n• Place of origin  \\n• Ethnic origin  \\n• Citizenship  \\n• Religion  \\n• Gender  \\n• Age  \\n• Record of offences  \\n• Marital status  \\n• Family status  \\n• Disability  \\n• Medical history  \\n \\nPROPRIETARY INFORMATION \\nIf you are asked to provide confidential information about a past \\nemployer, it is best to refrain from giving any information that is not \\npublicly available. Revealing information about a past employer, who may \\nor may not be a competitor, could create a breach of confidentiality. \\nEven though you may have worked for this employer some time ago, you \\nare still obligated to keep confidential information private. The \\ninterviewer could be testing to see if you divulge any company \\ninformation because doing so may be an indicator that you will reveal \\nconfidential information about the interviewer\\'s company.  \\nIf your portfolio includes performance reviews or samples of written \\nwork, ensure that no proprietary information is included, such as the \\nnames of customers or clients.  \\nHANDLING ILLEGAL QUESTIONS \\nWhat should you do if you\\'re in the middle of an interview and have just \\nbeen asked what is clearly an illegal question? There is no clear-cut \\nanswer. Much depends on you. \\nIn some cases, you may be able to answer the \"hidden\" question. Think of \\nwhat information the employer is trying to elicit. For example, \"Do you \\nhave or plan to have children?\" may indicate a concern about an ability to \\nwork overtime or to travel. In this example, your answer should convey \\nyour willingness to maintain a flexible work schedule. You may elect to \\nsay \"Why do you ask?\" or \"Would you explain how this point is \\nconnected to the qualifications for this job?\" This could cause the \\nemployer to reconsider or clarify the question. It may offend some \\nemployers, but probably not the majority. \\nIf you feel that you should not answer the question (you shouldn\\'t have \\nto, after all) or that you are not interested in working for the company, \\nyou may state, \"I don\\'t feel obligated to answer personal questions \\nunrelated to the position\" or \"That question seems inappropriate for an \\ninterview.\" If you choose this option, you will either enlighten (the \\nemployer may not realize it is illegal and will be happy that you pointed it \\nout) or offend (the employer may not consider you for the position). \\nFor more information about illegal interview questions, contact your \\nlocal, state or federal employment service office. \\nVERBAL AND NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION \\nSmile when appropriate during the interview. Be enthusiastic and \\nresponsive. As you talk about your past and present activities, your \\npassion and energy can be communicated both through your words and \\nyour body language (an excited tone of voice, leaning forward, nodding \\nyour head in agreement). Maintaining eye contact is important; failure to \\ndo so may imply a lack of confidence or, worse, cause the employer to \\nquestion your truthfulness.QUESTIONS YOU \\nCAN ASK \\nYour questions should be \\npertinent to the position and \\nshow your enthusiasm and \\nknowledge. By asking intelligent, \\nwell-thought-out questions that \\ngenuinely matter to you, you \\nwill convince the employer that \\nyou are serious about the \\norganization and the position. \\nAvoid asking questions \\nmentioned in the interview. \\n• What do you see as the \\npriorities for someone in \\nthis position?  \\n• Please describe a typical day \\non the job.  \\n• What training programs do \\nyou have available for your\\n \\nemployees?  \\n• What level of responsibility \\ncould I expect in this \\nposition?  \\n• What are the company\\'s \\nplans for the future?  \\n• What do you see as the \\ngreatest threat to the \\norganization?  \\n• What/where are the \\ngreatest opportunities for \\nthe organization?  \\n• How would you describe \\nyour organization\\'s \\nmanagement style, culture \\nor working environment?  \\n• What do you like most \\nabout your organization?  \\n• How are employees \\nevaluated and promoted?  \\n \\nSit comfortably, without slouching. Don\\'t put anything on your lap or in \\nyour hands if it will restrict your natural body movement or if you may be \\ntempted to play with it. Keep your clipboard, note pad, briefcase, or \\nportfolio on the floor beside your chair for easy retrieval.  \\nRespond to questions specifically and concisely but give sufficient details \\nto enable the interviewer to evaluate your credentials. Interviewers \\nbecome frustrated when they have to listen to long, rambling answers. \\nThink before you speak. It is quite acceptable to pause before talking in \\norder to organize your thoughts. Avoid verbal fillers such as \"um,\" \"ah,\" \\n\"you know,\" or regularly repeating the question to provide thinking time.  \\nUse business language. Avoid slang. Speak clearly. Watch the \\ninterviewer for clues on how the interview is progressing. Is the \\ninterviewer\\'s face or body language telling you that your answers are too \\nlong, not detailed enough, too boring? If in doubt, ask the interviewer if \\nmore or fewer details are needed.  \\nPrepare in advance to talk about any topic that you are concerned or feel \\nuncomfortable about. If there is something that you don’t want an \\ninterviewer to inquire about, it will likely be raised during the interview. \\nPractice your answer out loud often enough to feel confident. Maintain \\npoise and self-control. Consider a difficult issue as a learning opportunity \\nthat has made you a better person. \\nTYPES OF INTERVIEWS  \\nINDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS \\nThe most common interview format is one interviewer interviewing one \\ncandidate, either by phone, via video or in person.  \\nINTERVIEW WITH TWO OR MORE PEOPLE \\nIt is also common to be interviewed by a panel of people. Although it is \\nimportant to have good eye contact with the person who asks you a \\nquestion, also look at the other interviewers frequently to include them in \\nthe discussion. Try to remember each person\\'s name and use his or her \\nname during the interview. \\nGENERAL/GROUP INTERVIEW OR \\nINFORMATION SESSION  \\nThis approach is intended to provide applicants with a large amount of \\ninformation about the organization and the job. The format is used to \\nsave time and ensure that everyone understands the basic facts. This \\nprocess is usually followed by an individual interview. A well-timed and \\nintelligent question may help the employer remember you positively.INTERVIEW RESOURCES \\n \\nVirtual Mock-Interviews on \\nDolphin CareerLink \\n• Practice a mock-interview \\nrecorded on Dolphin \\nCareerLink. \\n• The video can be utilized \\nfor your own purposes or \\nsent to others for review. \\n• You can request CDS staff \\nto review and provide \\nfeedback. \\n \\nMock-Interview during \\nDrop-In Career Counseling \\n• Practice a mock-interview \\nwith CDS staff on a first-\\ncome, first-served basis, \\nwithout an appointment. \\n• The mock-interview will last \\napproximately 15-20 \\nminutes. Then CDS staff \\nwill provide 10-15 minutes \\nof feedback and or \\nsuggestions. \\n• You will need to bring your \\nresume and a copy of the \\nposition description (job \\nposting).  \\n• Even if you are not applying \\nto a specific position, you \\nwill need to bring a sample \\nposition description to \\neffectively conduct a mock-\\ninterview. \\n \\nEmployer Interviews \\n• Each semester, CDS brings \\nvarious local employers on \\ncampus to provide mock-\\ninterviews for students. \\n• Employers will vary each \\nsemester. \\n• Students can register for \\nthis event on Dolphin \\nCareerLink under \\n“Workshops.” \\n• Please visit the CDS \\nwebsite to find out which \\nemployers will be on \\ncampus. \\nCOMPETITIVE GROUP INTERVIEW \\nIn this interview format, one or more people interview many candidates at \\nthe same time. This type of interview is sometimes used when a position \\ninvolves teamwork and the interviewers want to see how you interact in a \\ngroup setting, when the company wants to see who emerges as a leader \\nwithin the group, or when people are being interviewed for several similar \\nroles within the company. It is important to thoughtfully and intelligently \\ncontribute, be attentive to the contributions of others, and not to \\nmonopolize the conversation. \\nTELEPHONE INTERVIEW \\nTelephone interviews are an effective way to quickly and cost-effectively \\nscreen or hire candidates. If there will be more than one interview, the first \\nmay be conducted by phone. Candidates being seriously considered may be \\ninvited to a subsequent on-site interview.  \\nIf you are not ready for an interview when called, politely request that the \\ninterviewer call back at another, mutually convenient, time. This request will \\nallow you to refresh your memory on the organization and consider what \\npoints you want to make.  \\nAll of the advice about interview skills still applies. Your attire is your \\nchoice, but you may find that dressing professionally increases your \\nconfidence and allows you to perform better. Keep your resume, company \\nresearch, points that you want to highlight, and list of questions handy; in \\nfact, keep these in front of you during the interview for easy reference. \\n(Don\\'t shuffle your papers though!) Have a pen and paper available to note \\nany comments or questions that may occur to you during the interview.  \\nChoose your words carefully and be succinct. It is also important to vary \\nyour voice tone, tempo, and pitch to keep the employer\\'s attention. Ensure \\nthat you are in a private setting to eliminate distractions and background \\nnoise. \\nVIDEO CONFERENCING \\nIn this type of interview, recruiters use video technology to conduct \\ninterviews at a distance. Use the same strategies you would if you were \\nmeeting in person; clothing, body language, and dialogue are important. \\nDepending on the sophistication of the technology, you may experience \\nshort transmission delays.  \\nMake eye contact with the camera, which, to the employer, appears as \\ndirect \"eye contact.\" Remember to check the monitor periodically to \\nobserve the interviewer\\'s body language.  \\nIf speaking on camera makes you nervous, try to practice in front of a video \\ncamera or mirror before your interview.AFTER THE INTERVIEW \\n \\n• Send a thank you note \\nwithin 48 hours! Make sure \\nyou express your continued \\ninterest in the position. \\n• Follow-up with the \\nemployer regarding the \\nposition. One of the \\nquestions you should always \\nask at the end of an \\ninterview is “What is the \\nnext step in the hiring \\nprocess?” If you were given \\npermission during the \\ninterview to follow-up in \\ntwo weeks, you don’t have \\nto worry about contacting \\nthem too soon or too late. \\n• Conduct research on \\npotential salary offerings for \\nthe position. If you need \\nhelp with salary negotiating, \\nplease visit Career \\nDevelopment Services \\nduring Drop-In Career \\nCounseling after the \\ninterview ASAP. \\n \\n \\nSECOND INTERVIEW \\nWhen interviewing you for a long-term position, a prospective employer \\nmay invite you and other finalists to visit the organization. The visit can \\ntake from one hour to an entire day. One purpose is to allow you to meet \\nother staff. The second is to give more people an opportunity to interview \\nyou in greater depth to determine whether a good match is developing.  \\nDo not assume that a second interview will lead to a job offer; ensure you \\nactively listen, ask relevant questions, and collect specific information about \\nthe company so you can elaborate on how your strengths match the \\norganization\\'s requirements. Use the opportunity to observe the work \\nenvironment (physical space, relations between employees, work pace) to \\ndetermine if the setting matches what you are seeking.  \\nAPPROACHES TO INTERVIEWING \\nStructured Interview \\nThe goal of this approach is to reduce bias and assist the employer in \\nmaking an objective decision. Typically, each candidate is asked the same \\nset of questions, responses are recorded, and ratings are assigned to each \\nresponse.  \\nUnstructured Interview \\nIn this format of interview, questions are based on the applicant\\'s resume, \\nso different questions will be posed to each applicant. Without structured \\nguidelines, the conversation can be free flowing, thus making this method \\nof interviewing the most prone to bias. Although this type of interview may \\nseem more casual, you must still be well prepared and know the points \\nyou want to make. Be careful not to provide information you would not \\nhave communicated if the interview was more structured.  \\nEnding the Interview \\nWhen it appears that the interviewer is about to end the interview, you \\nshould make sure you have covered certain points before you leave the \\nroom. Make sure you understand the process that will occur before a \\ncandidate is selected for the job (another interview, meetings with other \\nindividuals in the organization, etc.). Ask the interviewer when you can \\nexpect to hear about a decision or ask when you should make an inquiry \\nas a follow-up. \\nEnthusiastically express your interest in the position (unless you are sure that \\nyou are not interested) and thank the interviewer for interviewing you. Ask \\nfor a business card or ensure that you have the interviewer\\'s name, title, and \\naddress so that you can send a thank you letter. Mak\\ne sure your letter is sent \\nwithin 48 hours of the interview. In addition to being a standard business \\ncourtesy, a thank you letter may tip the scales in your favor if you are in close \\ncontention for the job.Interview Evaluation \\nIf you do not receive a job offer and you felt that the fit was very good, \\nconsider contacting the interviewer for feedback on your performance. Did \\nthe interviewer hire someone better qualified for the position? If so, what \\nadditional qualifications might you need to be hired for a similar position? \\nDid you adequately present your qualifications? If not, stay motivated but \\nlearn from any feedback and make necessary changes for your next \\ninterview. \\nCONTACT INFORMATION \\nCAREER DEVELOPMENT SERVICES \\n \\n \\nOne University Drive, Bell Tower 1548 \\n(805) 437-3270 (office) \\n(805) 437-8899 (fax) \\ncareer.services@csuci.edu \\nFor further assistance please visit us during  \\nDrop-In Career Counseling.']"

The primary objectives are to:  \\n• Supplement resume information  \\n• Show that you understand your strengths and weaknesses and have a \\nsense of direction  \\n• Enable the employer to evaluate your personality and attitudes in \\nterms of the demands of the organization and the position  \\n• Allow you to gain information about the organization and the job \\nthat is not available through other sources  \\n• Give you and the employer an opportunity to discuss the desirability \\nof further contact or an offer of employment  \\nThe interview is a two-way process. You evaluate the employer while \\nhe/she evaluates you. Since there is no one way of interviewing, you will \\nhave to develop your own style. In order to present yourself well during \\nthe interview, you must be prepared. Preparation builds confidence and \\nenables you to give a better presentation of your qualifications. \\nINTERVIEW PREPARATION  \\nFirst Impressions \\nYour success or failure in an interview can depend on your appearance \\nand the interviewer\\'s first impression of you. Research indicates that, on \\naverage, an interviewer decides to hire in just 5½ minutes. If the first \\nimpression is not positive, it will be difficult to change the interviewer\\'s \\nmind during the rest of the interview.  \\nBe punctual. Arrive 10 minutes early to allow yourself time to collect \\nyour thoughts. Take the opportunity to observe the work environment. \\nKeep your eyes and ears open.  \\nLook professional—neat, clean, and well groomed. Select proper \\nclothing for the type of organization interviewing you. If in doubt, be \\nconservative. It is also advisable to keep fashion accessories to a \\nminimum, to avoid wearing strong scents, and to turn off devices such as \\ncell phones and electronic organizers. \\nGreet each person with respect and professionalism. When you shake \\nhands, make eye contact and smile. Handshakes should be firm but not \\naggressive; try to match the grip of the interviewer. It is good etiquette \\nto wait to sit down until the interviewer invites you to do so.  \\nKnow the Company/Organization \\nYou must be familiar with the position and the organization so that you \\ncan demonstrate your interest in and fit for the job. Refer to the \\nresearch notes you made as you reviewed print and online materials, \\nspoke with people about the position, and prepared your resume and \\ncover letter. \\n \\nINTERVIEW CHECKLIST: \\n• 5-10 copies of your resume \\n• A portfolio/notebook  \\n• Pen/pencil \\n• Questions for the interviewers \\n• Positive attitude \\n• Professionally dressed \\n \\nPROFESSIONAL ATTIRE: \\n• Solid color, conservative suit \\n• Coordinated blouse/shirt \\n• Minimal jewelry/accessories/tie \\n• Moderate shoes \\n• Neat, professional hairstyle \\n• Manicured nailsBEHAVIOR-BASED \\nQUESTIONS \\n• Describe a time when you \\nwere faced with problems or \\nstresses that tested your \\ncoping skills and how you \\nhandled it. \\n \\n• Describe a time when your \\nwork was harshly criticized. \\nHow did you react to this \\nfeedback? \\n \\n• Tell me about a time when a \\nproject really excited you. \\n \\n• Tell me about a situation \\nwhen you had absolutely no \\nidea how to approach a \\nproblem and how you \\neventually solved it. \\n \\n• Give me an example of a \\nsituation when your solution \\nto a problem did not help. \\nWhat was the outcome? \\n \\n• Describe the steps you \\nwould take if a customer \\ncame to you with a problem \\nthat was beyond your \\nresponsibilities but your \\nsupervisor was not available. \\n \\n• How would you handle a co-\\nworker who you notice \\nbeing rude to customers? \\n \\n• Tell me about a time when \\nyou had to adapt to people \\nfrom different cultures and \\nenvironments. \\n•  \\nCAR METHOD TO \\nANSWERING BEHAVIOR-\\nBASED QUESTIONS \\n• Use a three step process:      \\n1) context/situation 2) action \\n3) result or outcome.  \\n \\n \\n \\nA commonly asked interview question is: \"What do you know about our \\ncompany?\" If you are unable to answer this question effectively, \\nemployers will see this as a sign of lack of planning or interest. \\nResearch the Employer \\nThoroughly research the organization to impress those with whom you \\nmeet and discuss your alignment with the company.  \\nSuggested information to research: \\n• Key people in the organization \\n• Size of organization \\n• Location of facilities \\n• Structure of organization \\n• Types of clients \\n• Product line or service \\n• Potential markets \\n• Stock and assets information \\n• Competition \\n• Training provisions \\n• Recent news items \\n \\nYou can find this information in the following places: \\n• Employer brochures \\n• Public Relations \\n• Glassdoor.com \\n• Company website/Internet \\n• Other employees \\n \\nANSWERING INTERVIEW QUESTIONS \\nThe next phase of the interview consists of the interviewer asking you \\nquestions to try to determine your fit. Having knowledge of potential \\nquestions helps you to prepare points to include in your answers. Think \\nabout why a question is being asked. What does the employer really \\nwant to know? \\nBehavior-based and situational/hypothetical questions are increasing in \\npopularity because they are considered to be more valid predictors of \\non-the-job performance.  \\nBehavior-Based Questions \\nBehavior-based interviews are designed to elicit information about how \\nyou have performed in the past because past behavior is a good indicator \\nof how you will function in the future. Interviewers develop their \\nquestions around the traits and skills they consider necessary for \\nsucceeding in a position or organization.  \\nThese questions usually begin with phrases such as:  \\n• Tell me about a time...  \\n• Describe a situation in which...  \\n• Recall an instance when…  \\n• Give me an example of…  \\nSome applicants find the format of these questions difficult to understand \\nand have trouble responding. However, if you have done your research \\nand prepared for the interview, you will have work, academic, and life \\nexperiences ready to share. You can prepare for behavior-based \\nquestions by recalling specific actions that demonstrate your• Always cite a specific event and \\nbriefly fill the employer in on \\nthe situation.  \\n• Have a thorough \\nunderstanding of the \\nquestions.  \\n• Ask for clarification if \\nneeded. \\n• Deal with all questions \\npositively. \\n• Some questions give you the \\nchance to acknowledge your \\nfailures while showing how \\nyou have learned from them. \\n• Don\\'t be afraid to take a few \\nmoments to think about the \\nquestion--it\\'s better than \\nmaking something up! \\n \\nEXAMPLE \\n“Tell me about a time you had a \\ndifficult customer. How did you \\nhandle the situation?” \\n \\nWhen I was working at XYZ \\nCompany as an entry-level sales \\nassociate, a customer wanted to \\nreturn an item purchased over \\nnine months ago due to \\ndissatisfaction (Context). I \\ninformed the customer that the \\nproduct no longer met the \\ncompany’s return policy and the \\ncustomer became angry and \\ndemanded to speak with a \\nsupervisor.  I calmly let the \\ncustomer know that I would be \\nhappy to assist them in their \\nrequest and shared other \\nproducts as alternative solutions \\nas the customer waited for a \\nsupervisor (Action).  \\nEventually, the customer calmed \\ndown when I provided suitable \\nalternative options and even \\napologized for being rude to me \\nearlier (Results). \\n \\naccomplishments, abilities, and fit for the position. Be certain to tell the \\ntruth, get to the point, stay focused, turn negatives into positives, and be \\nconsistent with your responses.  \\nAnswering Behavior-Based Questions: W5 Model  \\nThe W5 model is a useful method for answering a behavior-based \\nquestion. The answer should take approximately 90 seconds (the length \\nof a typical attention span). \\n70 seconds - Identify the skill/knowledge/ability and give an example of \\nhow you applied or developed it by explaining:  \\n• What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How  \\n• What the successful outcome was  \\n20 seconds - Re-state the skill and outline the benefits transferable to \\nthe interviewer’s organization  \\nCOMMON BEHAVIOR-BASED INTERVIEW THEMES \\nINCLUDE:  \\n• Working effectively under pressure  \\n• Handling a difficult situation with a co-worker  \\n• Applying good judgment and logic in solving a problem  \\n• Completing a project on time  \\n• Persuading team members to do things your way  \\n• Writing a report or proposal that was well received  \\n• Anticipating potential problems and developing preventative \\nmeasures  \\n• Making an important decision with limited facts and information  \\n• Making a quick decision during the absence of a supervisor  \\n• Making an unpopular decision  \\n• Adapting to a difficult situation  \\n• Being tolerant of a different opinion  \\n• Dealing with an upset client or customer  \\n• Delegating a project effectively  \\n• Explaining complex information to a client, colleague or peer  \\nBy analyzing the questions asked of you, you will discover further details \\nabout the position. Does the interviewer seem to be emphasizing certain \\nskills, knowledge, personality traits, and attitudes? That insight can help you \\ntailor your answers more easily to the employer’s position. \\nFor example, in response to the query \"What experience do you have \\norganizing projects?\" you determine that the qualification being evaluated \\nis organizational skills. Your statement could be, \"I have developed \\nexcellent organizational skills by working on two major projects. The one \\nI would like to tell you about ended successfully six months ago.\"  \\nEvery statement you make must be true! Don’t lie or embellish. Ideally, \\nthe illustration you choose to confirm your statement should be a \\nproject that required similar competency to the typical project theprospective employer wants you to complete. If you do not have a \\nsimilar experience to relate, try to choose a relevant story from your \\nacademic, extracurricular, or volunteer activities.  \\nChoose words that will help the employer visualize you in the \\nexperience. Whenever possible, include positive feedback from \\nsupervisors, colleagues, professors, and others to reinforce your \\naccomplishment.  \\nThe next step is the one that most candidates forget. Tell the interviewer \\nwhat specific benefits or competitive advantage you can bring to the \\nposition because of the experience you have just described. For example, \\n\"As part of the team, I would be able to coordinate....\" Avoid generic \\nstatements such as \"All organizations need people with leadership ability.\"  \\nSituational/Hypothetical Questions  \\nAn interviewer will use situational/hypothetical questions to establish \\nhow you would react to and handle real-life situations on the job. For \\nsituational/hypothetical questions, candidates must have a good \\nunderstanding of the job and its requirements.  \\nHere are some examples of this type of question: \\n• If you had met your project deadlines and your direct supervisor was \\nunavailable, describe how you would remain busy.  \\n• You are the manager of a small marketing team, and one individual is \\ncontinually late for work and taking extended breaks. How would you \\napproach the issue?  \\n• During construction, a contractor unexpectedly finds a very large \\nobject in one of the trenches where he is about to dig. He requests \\nthat you tell him how to proceed. How would you deal with this \\nsituation?  \\n• You plan a workshop to teach newcomers to the country how to use \\nword processing software. Unfortunately, only four people have \\nregistered and you are required to have a class of ten. It is five days \\nbefore the class is scheduled to begin. What do you do?  \\n• You have a conflict with someone who is senior to you and is not \\nyour supervisor. Describe how you would handle it.  \\n \\nCLASSIC QUESTIONS \\nIn addition to asking the other \\ntypes of questions, many employers \\nrely on a series of standard \\nquestions, and you should prepare \\nfor them: \\n \\n• Tell me about yourself. \\n• What are your short-term \\ngoals? What about in two and \\nfive years? How are you \\npreparing to achieve them?  \\n• What is your vision or mission \\nstatement?  \\n• What do you think you will be \\nlooking for in the job following \\nthis position?  \\n• Why do you feel you will be \\nsuccessful in this work?  \\n• What other types of work are \\nyou looking for in addition to \\nthis role?  \\n• What supervisory or \\nleadership roles have you had?  \\n• For you, what are some \\nadvantages and disadvantages \\nof working in a team \\nenvironment?  \\n• What did you like/dislike about \\nyour last job?  \\n• What motivates you to do a \\ngood job?  \\n• What are your \\nstrengths/weaknesses?  \\n• What kinds of problems do \\nyou handle best?  \\n• How do you reduce stress and \\ntry to achieve balance in your \\nlife?  \\n• How did you handle a request \\nto do something contrary to \\nyour moral code or business \\nethics?  \\n• What do you know about us?HOW TO SHARE \\nYOUR STORY \\nIn an interview, you need at \\nleast five to eight stories that \\nhighlight skills, accomplishments, \\ncharacter traits, or passions. \\nPeople remember stories, and \\nyou want to be memorable. All \\nstories should have a purpose in \\ntelling them, either to highlight \\nsomething you did or to \\ndemonstrate you learned \\nsomething. All stories have a \\nbeginning, middle, and an end. \\nLeave one out and it\\'s not a \\nstory. \\nBEGINNING: Describe the \\nscene so the interviewer \\nunderstands the context. \\nMIDDLE: Next, identify what \\nYOU did to make this happen. \\nBe specific and make sure you \\nare teaching the person \\nsomething positive about you. \\nEND: Share the results of what \\nhappened. Even if it was not \\npositive, what did you learn \\nfrom it? Describe what you \\nwould do differently next time. \\n \\nANSWERING CLASSIC QUESTIONS- PAWS MODEL  \\nThe PAWS model is a useful method for answering classic questions \\nsuch as \"Tell me about yourself.\" The answer should take approximately \\n90 seconds (the length of a typical attention span). \\nWhen an employer asks this question, the employer is looking for those \\naspects of your life that are relevant to the job, such as how you became \\ninterested in the field, related experience, and courses taken. \\nThe \"PAWS\" acronym stands for Profile, Academic, Work, and Skills. \\nInclude all or as many of the four (in any order) to reinforce your fit for \\nthe job. As with any interview response, limit your answer to a \\nmaximum of ninety seconds. Here are some examples of what to discuss \\nin each of the four areas: \\nProfile: Mention how you became interested in this field and perhaps \\npoint out any relevant community involvement, extracurricular activities, \\nmemberships, and personal interests that further demonstrate your \\ncommitment to the field  \\nAcademic: Talk about your educational background \\n(degrees/diplomas/certifications) and other related training and \\nprofessional development initiatives/courses that you participated in  \\nWork: Highlight paid or unpaid experience related to the job  \\nSkills: Refer to specific technical skills that relate to the position or field \\n(programming C++, knowledge of GIS) and relevant transferable skills \\n(time management, problem-solving skills)TRICKY SITUATIONS \\nAwkward situations may occur \\nduring an interview, and it is up \\nto you to be prepared to \\nconfidently handle whatever \\nhappens. To increase your \\nconfidence and prepare for an \\ninterview, practice interviewing. \\nCheck for quality of information \\nin your answers, and the \\npositive, non-verbal \\nreinforcement of your words. \\nBy practicing responses out \\nloud, you can hear your \\nanswers and assess their \\neffectiveness; however, don\\'t \\npractice so much that you lose \\nyour spontaneity and your \\nanswers sound rehearsed. \\nThe key to tricky situations is \\nto remember that barriers to \\nemployment can often be \\novercome by focusing on the \\npositive. Circumstances that \\nyou may find problematic are: \\n1. Salary  \\n2. Silence  \\n3. Interviewer is an excessive \\ntalker  \\n4. Note-taking  \\n5. Being stumped  \\n6. Negative questions  \\n7. Many short-term jobs or \\ngaps in employment history  \\n8. Having never worked or no \\nrecent work experience  \\n9. Being over-/under-qualified  \\n10. Low grades  \\n11. Ageism  \\n12. Disclosure of disability  \\n13. Reasons for leaving last job  \\n14. Poor or no references  \\n15. Proprietary information  \\n \\nSALARY \\nIf applying for short-term work (such as co-op or summer positions), you \\nwill likely have only one interview, so it is acceptable to discuss salary. If \\nyou need to know the salary and it has not been discussed, ask about it as \\nyour final question. \\nEmployers hiring full-time or contract staff may inquire about salary \\nduring a first interview to see if your expectations are compatible with \\nwhat they are offering and to see how much value you place on your \\nexperience, skills, and educational background. Try to defer the subject \\nuntil you have been offered the job, but if the employer insists, be \\nprepared to offer a salary range that you know is realistic based on your \\nresearch.  \\nOver eighty percent of employers expect you to negotiate salary. \\nTherefore, it is appropriate to do your salary research and develop a \\nnegotiation strategy. Visit the Career Development Center to discuss \\nsalary negotiation techniques with a career counselor. \\nSILENCE \\nIf you answer a question and there is no prompt response or follow-up \\nquestion, what do you do? Try to remain calm and collected. Silence may \\nnot be a negative sign; the employer could be taking time to process and \\nrecord your answer or could be considering the next question. A few \\nemployers create periods of silence during an interview to see how \\ncandidates handle stressful and awkward situations.  \\nIn response to uncomfortable silence, ask the interviewers if they require \\nany further details regarding your last response, shifting the responsibility \\nto them. Resist the temptation to ramble because you may provide \\nirrelevant information that may hurt your chances of being offered the \\njob. \\nNOTE-TAKING \\nAlthough the interviewer will likely take notes, generally you should take \\nbasic notes. If you have your head down writing everything frantically, the \\nconversation will be uncomfortable and disengaged because of your lack \\nof eye contact and inability to show enthusiasm. \\nMaking brief notes is acceptable when you need to record information \\nthat may be easily forgotten, such as a key word, phone number or \\ncontact information. If you fear you may not recall other pertinent \\ndetails, document the information immediately after the interview.BEING STUMPED \\nTry not to focus on “what you \\nshould say.” Focus on the \\npurpose of this question. What \\ndo you think they want to know \\nabout you, based on the question \\nthey asked? They might be \\npurposely testing your ability to \\nsolve problems under pressure.  \\nProvide a response that \\ndemonstrates your process in \\nfinding a solution to a problem.  \\n \\nExample:  What is your \\nexperience with supervising \\nothers? \\n \\n• They might want to know \\nyour leadership style, or \\nhow you handle conflict \\nbetween co-workers. \\n \\n“I haven’t had the opportunity to \\nsupervise others yet.  However, I \\nled my senior capstone project in \\ndeveloping a business \\nplan…(provide detailed info on \\nhow you lead the team).” \\n \\n“In the past three years working \\nat XYZ Company, my leadership \\nresponsibilities have grown  from \\nbeing part of a project team to \\nspearheading a new \\nproject…(provide detail info on \\nhow you’ve increased your \\nleadership opportunity).” \\nBEING STUMPED \\nYou may have difficulty communicating your thoughts clearly and \\nconcisely, especially when you are not sure how to respond to a \\nquestion. The key is to remain calm and positive, focus on the question, \\nand continue to remind yourself that you are doing well. You may \\nrequest clarification if you are not sure what the interviewer is asking or \\npause and politely ask for a few moments to consider your response; \\nhowever, don\\'t take too much time because employers want to see that \\nyou can think well under pressure. \\nAfter a brief pause, if you still cannot respond to the interviewer\\'s \\nquestion, you may ask to defer your answer to the end of the interview. \\nThe risk is that interviews usually follow a certain structure and the \\nquestion might be missed entirely, leaving the interviewer with an \\nunanswered question. Of course, if you’re stumped because you simply \\ndo not know the answer, be honest with the interviewer in a positive \\nand professional manner. \\nWhen asked a question about a skill that you don\\'t have, demonstrate \\nthat you have the transferable skills necessary to succeed in the position. \\nFor example, \"I have excellent computer skills but I do not have \\nknowledge of that specific software. However, I did learn Dreamweaver, \\na similar program, on my own and quickly applied the concepts by \\nindependently creating a website for a project that received a grade of \\n90%.\" \\nNEGATIVE QUESTIONS \\nInterviewers will often ask negatively phrased questions to assess your \\nperceived weaknesses and strengths. The following are a few examples:  \\n• What are your weaknesses as an employee?  \\n• Recall a time from your work experience when you made a bad \\ndecision or mistake. How did you get beyond it?  \\n• Give me an example of a time you did not meet a project \\ndeadline. How did you handle the situation?  \\nBe honest and discuss a real work-related weakness or past event that \\nwould not negatively impact performance for the job you are applying \\nfor. Avoid the popular advice to turn a weakness into a strength (for \\nexample, \"I\\'m a perfectionist...\") because this kind of response is \\nunconvincing and over used. Be sure to end your \"weakness\" response \\non a positive note by indicating what steps you are taking to overcome \\nthe weakness. \\nIt is important to be as positive as possible, even when answering a \\nnegatively framed question, and to keep your answer short.GAPS IN EMPLOYMENT \\nEXPLANATIONS \\n \\n“While I was in between \\npositions, I volunteered at XYZ \\nCompany to improve my \\ncustomer service skills.” \\n“I utilized this gap in \\nemployment to help out my \\nfamily, which also gave me the \\nchance to improve my \\ncomputer and time management \\nskills.  I completed several self-\\nguided courses online through \\nLynda.com” \\n \\nMANY SHORT-TERM JOBS OR GAPS IN \\nEMPLOYMENT HISTORY  \\nIt is becoming more common to work for shorter periods for a variety of \\nemployers, so employers may not place as much emphasis on dates \\nworked as they might have in the past. However, if asked, be prepared to \\nprovide reasons that the employer will understand for your frequent job \\nchanges or gaps in employment history.  \\nGaps in your employment history can occur for many reasons, some \\nwithin and some beyond your control: short-term positions, lay-offs, \\nhealth or personal concerns, raising a family, extensive traveling, \\ncompleting a degree, unemployment, or time for career planning. In \\ncreating a targeted resume, you may also have chosen to omit some \\nexperiences. \\nAlthough you should truthfully explain in a few words the reasons for \\nyour job changes or gaps in employment, focus on what you did during \\nthe gaps that was related to the position. \\nHAVING NEVER WORKED OR NO RECENT \\nWORK EXPERIENCE  \\nTell the interviewer about any relevant courses, workshops, volunteer or \\ninternship experiences, and extracurricular activities. Indicate if you have \\nresearched and joined associations or societies in your field to learn or \\nstay knowledgeable about industry trends and connect with other \\nprofessionals. Convey your interest in the position and indicate that you \\nlook forward to a long-term association with the company. \\nBEING UNDER-/OVER-QUALIFIED \\nAlthough you may be concerned about your qualifications, the \\ninterviewer liked something about your resume or you wouldn’t have \\nbeen offered an interview! Counter the interviewer\\'s fear that you may \\nnot be suitable by emphasizing your positive traits and describing how \\nyour experience, education, and skills will help you succeed in the \\nposition. Demonstrate to the employer your commitment by describing \\nhow the position aligns with your career goals and how your decision to \\napply for the position was carefully planned.  \\nLOW GRADES \\nLow grades can stem from a lack of commitment (such as skipping classes \\nor excessive socializing), enrollment in an unsuitable program, or dealing \\nwith traumatic personal events. In any case, explain briefly and honestly \\nwhat happened and describe what steps you have taken to remedy the \\nsituation so that it is no longer an issue: \"I know my grades were less \\nthan stellar during my third year, but I really improved this term because I \\nattended a series of study skill workshops and they made a huge impact. I \\nnow know how to manage my time successfully, and I’m confident that I \\nwill perform well in this position.\"IF YOU HAVE POOR OR \\nNO REFERENCES: \\nIf you were unable to obtain a \\nreference from your previous \\nplace of employment because \\nyou left on bad terms, you must \\nbriefly explain why. Read the \\nsection on \"Reasons for Leaving \\nLast Job.\" \\nQuickly follow up your \\nstatement to suggest that the \\ninterviewer contact other \\nreferences from your list to \\nobtain a more accurate picture \\nof your previous work \\nexperiences. Stress how direct \\nmanagers, supervisors, teachers, \\nand colleagues enjoyed working \\nwith you and can attest to your \\nachievements and skills. \\nIf your references are outdated, \\nyou must decide if they are still \\nappropriate to use. If you feel \\nyour referees can still \\nsuccessfully highlight your skills, \\nfollow up with them to request \\ntheir permission to be \\ncontacted by potential \\nemployers. You will also want \\nto remind them of your \\nprevious accomplishments and \\nprovide them with an updated \\nresume. If you do not obtain \\ntheir permission, you must \\nobtain new references by \\nvolunteering, requesting client \\ntestimonials, etc. \\n \\nDISCLOSURE OF DISABILITY \\nPeople with physical, sensory or learning disabilities or chronic medical \\nconditions are advised, like all job seekers, to focus on their abilities and \\ninterests when choosing a career. \\nIt is important to be up front and honest about your situation if your \\ndisability may present a performance barrier or if you need to request \\naccommodation or assistive devices. If you determine that your disability \\ndoes not pose any risk to you or to fellow workers, you may choose to \\ndisclose your disability once a job offer is formally presented. It is not \\nnecessary to disclose your disability in your resume or cover letter, \\nalthough you may prefer to do so if the company you are applying to has \\na specific policy to hire people with disabilities or if you are applying to an \\nagency that deals with persons with disabilities. \\nEmployers may not understand what your disability involves and may feel \\nuncomfortable asking; the result is that they may perceive your disability \\nto be more of a barrier than it actually is. Determine how you can \\novercome or compensate for any perceived or real stumbling blocks to \\nemployment so that you can explain your situation more clearly and \\npositively. For example, you may say, \"Due to a spinal injury, I have no \\nsensation in my legs. I can get around and travel easily in my wheelchair. \\nMy injury does not affect how I think, solve problems, or communicate \\nand will not affect my performance on the job.\" You may also want to ask \\nif the employer has any additional questions. \\nSome regions offer assistance to help you secure employment. As well as \\noffering job placement programs, programs may provide you with \\nspecialized equipment, sign language interpreters, readers, and note \\ntakers to help you with job searching and interviewing. \\nREASONS FOR LEAVING LAST JOB \\nAn employer may inquire about your reasons for leaving a job to \\ndetermine if concerns from a previous job might impact the organization. \\nEmployers like to gauge your attitude toward work, management, \\norganizational change, and policies or guidelines. \\nBegin your response with a positive statement regarding your previous \\nplace of employment. Honestly and concisely state your reasons for \\nleaving. If you left on good terms, offer the interviewer letters of \\nreference that outline your relevant achievements. If the conditions under \\nwhich you left were negative, focus the interviewer’s attention on what \\nyou accomplished and avoid speaking negatively about past managers, \\ncolleagues or the organization. Emphasize that you will be able to handle \\nthe present job no matter what may have happened in the past.YOUR RIGHTS IN THE \\nINTERVIEW \\nThere are clear legal rights and \\nguidelines for employment \\ninterview questions. An \\napplicant for employment may \\nbe asked to divulge only \\ninformation relevant to the \\nposition applied for. By law, an \\nemployer must focus on \\ngathering information relevant \\nto deciding if an applicant can \\nperform the functions of a \\nposition. \\nSome employers mistakenly \\nbelieve that they have a right to \\nask any question they choose \\nsince they are paying the salary. \\nOthers are simply awkward in \\ntheir technique and an unlawful \\nquestion results. However, the \\nlaw does not distinguish \\nbetween the interviewer who is \\nasking questions with the intent \\nto discriminate and the one \\nwho is just curious or inept at \\ninterviewing. \\nSome questions are \\ninappropriate and others are \\nillegal. You do not have to \\nanswer questions that are illegal. \\nMost regions have laws that \\nprohibit discrimination in \\nemployment on the grounds of: \\n• Race  \\n• Ancestry  \\n• Place of origin  \\n• Ethnic origin  \\n• Citizenship  \\n• Religion  \\n• Gender  \\n• Age  \\n• Record of offences  \\n• Marital status  \\n• Family status  \\n• Disability  \\n• Medical history  \\n \\nPROPRIETARY INFORMATION \\nIf you are asked to provide confidential information about a past \\nemployer, it is best to refrain from giving any information that is not \\npublicly available. Revealing information about a past employer, who may \\nor may not be a competitor, could create a breach of confidentiality. \\nEven though you may have worked for this employer some time ago, you \\nare still obligated to keep confidential information private. The \\ninterviewer could be testing to see if you divulge any company \\ninformation because doing so may be an indicator that you will reveal \\nconfidential information about the interviewer\\'s company.  \\nIf your portfolio includes performance reviews or samples of written \\nwork, ensure that no proprietary information is included, such as the \\nnames of customers or clients.  \\nHANDLING ILLEGAL QUESTIONS \\nWhat should you do if you\\'re in the middle of an interview and have just \\nbeen asked what is clearly an illegal question? There is no clear-cut \\nanswer. Much depends on you. \\nIn some cases, you may be able to answer the \"hidden\" question. Think of \\nwhat information the employer is trying to elicit. For example, \"Do you \\nhave or plan to have children?\" may indicate a concern about an ability to \\nwork overtime or to travel. In this example, your answer should convey \\nyour willingness to maintain a flexible work schedule. You may elect to \\nsay \"Why do you ask?\" or \"Would you explain how this point is \\nconnected to the qualifications for this job?\" This could cause the \\nemployer to reconsider or clarify the question. It may offend some \\nemployers, but probably not the majority. \\nIf you feel that you should not answer the question (you shouldn\\'t have \\nto, after all) or that you are not interested in working for the company, \\nyou may state, \"I don\\'t feel obligated to answer personal questions \\nunrelated to the position\" or \"That question seems inappropriate for an \\ninterview.\" If you choose this option, you will either enlighten (the \\nemployer may not realize it is illegal and will be happy that you pointed it \\nout) or offend (the employer may not consider you for the position). \\nFor more information about illegal interview questions, contact your \\nlocal, state or federal employment service office. \\nVERBAL AND NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION \\nSmile when appropriate during the interview. Be enthusiastic and \\nresponsive. As you talk about your past and present activities, your \\npassion and energy can be communicated both through your words and \\nyour body language (an excited tone of voice, leaning forward, nodding \\nyour head in agreement). Maintaining eye contact is important; failure to \\ndo so may imply a lack of confidence or, worse, cause the employer to \\nquestion your truthfulness.QUESTIONS YOU \\nCAN ASK \\nYour questions should be \\npertinent to the position and \\nshow your enthusiasm and \\nknowledge. By asking intelligent, \\nwell-thought-out questions that \\ngenuinely matter to you, you \\nwill convince the employer that \\nyou are serious about the \\norganization and the position. \\nAvoid asking questions \\nmentioned in the interview. \\n• What do you see as the \\npriorities for someone in \\nthis position?  \\n• Please describe a typical day \\non the job.  \\n• What training programs do \\nyou have available for your\\n \\nemployees?  \\n• What level of responsibility \\ncould I expect in this \\nposition?  \\n• What are the company\\'s \\nplans for the future?  \\n• What do you see as the \\ngreatest threat to the \\norganization?  \\n• What/where are the \\ngreatest opportunities for \\nthe organization?  \\n• How would you describe \\nyour organization\\'s \\nmanagement style, culture \\nor working environment?  \\n• What do you like most \\nabout your organization?  \\n• How are employees \\nevaluated and promoted?  \\n \\nSit comfortably, without slouching. Don\\'t put anything on your lap or in \\nyour hands if it will restrict your natural body movement or if you may be \\ntempted to play with it. Keep your clipboard, note pad, briefcase, or \\nportfolio on the floor beside your chair for easy retrieval.  \\nRespond to questions specifically and concisely but give sufficient details \\nto enable the interviewer to evaluate your credentials. Interviewers \\nbecome frustrated when they have to listen to long, rambling answers. \\nThink before you speak. It is quite acceptable to pause before talking in \\norder to organize your thoughts. Avoid verbal fillers such as \"um,\" \"ah,\" \\n\"you know,\" or regularly repeating the question to provide thinking time.  \\nUse business language. Avoid slang. Speak clearly. Watch the \\ninterviewer for clues on how the interview is progressing. Is the \\ninterviewer\\'s face or body language telling you that your answers are too \\nlong, not detailed enough, too boring? If in doubt, ask the interviewer if \\nmore or fewer details are needed.  \\nPrepare in advance to talk about any topic that you are concerned or feel \\nuncomfortable about. If there is something that you don’t want an \\ninterviewer to inquire about, it will likely be raised during the interview. \\nPractice your answer out loud often enough to feel confident. Maintain \\npoise and self-control. Consider a difficult issue as a learning opportunity \\nthat has made you a better person. \\nTYPES OF INTERVIEWS  \\nINDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS \\nThe most common interview format is one interviewer interviewing one \\ncandidate, either by phone, via video or in person.  \\nINTERVIEW WITH TWO OR MORE PEOPLE \\nIt is also common to be interviewed by a panel of people. Although it is \\nimportant to have good eye contact with the person who asks you a \\nquestion, also look at the other interviewers frequently to include them in \\nthe discussion. Try to remember each person\\'s name and use his or her \\nname during the interview. \\nGENERAL/GROUP INTERVIEW OR \\nINFORMATION SESSION  \\nThis approach is intended to provide applicants with a large amount of \\ninformation about the organization and the job. The format is used to \\nsave time and ensure that everyone understands the basic facts. This \\nprocess is usually followed by an individual interview. A well-timed and \\nintelligent question may help the employer remember you positively.INTERVIEW RESOURCES \\n \\nVirtual Mock-Interviews on \\nDolphin CareerLink \\n• Practice a mock-interview \\nrecorded on Dolphin \\nCareerLink. \\n• The video can be utilized \\nfor your own purposes or \\nsent to others for review. \\n• You can request CDS staff \\nto review and provide \\nfeedback. \\n \\nMock-Interview during \\nDrop-In Career Counseling \\n• Practice a mock-interview \\nwith CDS staff on a first-\\ncome, first-served basis, \\nwithout an appointment. \\n• The mock-interview will last \\napproximately 15-20 \\nminutes. Then CDS staff \\nwill provide 10-15 minutes \\nof feedback and or \\nsuggestions. \\n• You will need to bring your \\nresume and a copy of the \\nposition description (job \\nposting).  \\n• Even if you are not applying \\nto a specific position, you \\nwill need to bring a sample \\nposition description to \\neffectively conduct a mock-\\ninterview. \\n \\nEmployer Interviews \\n• Each semester, CDS brings \\nvarious local employers on \\ncampus to provide mock-\\ninterviews for students. \\n• Employers will vary each \\nsemester. \\n• Students can register for \\nthis event on Dolphin \\nCareerLink under \\n“Workshops.” \\n• Please visit the CDS \\nwebsite to find out which \\nemployers will be on \\ncampus. \\nCOMPETITIVE GROUP INTERVIEW \\nIn this interview format, one or more people interview many candidates at \\nthe same time. This type of interview is sometimes used when a position \\ninvolves teamwork and the interviewers want to see how you interact in a \\ngroup setting, when the company wants to see who emerges as a leader \\nwithin the group, or when people are being interviewed for several similar \\nroles within the company. It is important to thoughtfully and intelligently \\ncontribute, be attentive to the contributions of others, and not to \\nmonopolize the conversation. \\nTELEPHONE INTERVIEW \\nTelephone interviews are an effective way to quickly and cost-effectively \\nscreen or hire candidates. If there will be more than one interview, the first \\nmay be conducted by phone. Candidates being seriously considered may be \\ninvited to a subsequent on-site interview.  \\nIf you are not ready for an interview when called, politely request that the \\ninterviewer call back at another, mutually convenient, time. This request will \\nallow you to refresh your memory on the organization and consider what \\npoints you want to make.  \\nAll of the advice about interview skills still applies. Your attire is your \\nchoice, but you may find that dressing professionally increases your \\nconfidence and allows you to perform better. Keep your resume, company \\nresearch, points that you want to highlight, and list of questions handy; in \\nfact, keep these in front of you during the interview for easy reference. \\n(Don\\'t shuffle your papers though!) Have a pen and paper available to note \\nany comments or questions that may occur to you during the interview.  \\nChoose your words carefully and be succinct. It is also important to vary \\nyour voice tone, tempo, and pitch to keep the employer\\'s attention. Ensure \\nthat you are in a private setting to eliminate distractions and background \\nnoise. \\nVIDEO CONFERENCING \\nIn this type of interview, recruiters use video technology to conduct \\ninterviews at a distance. Use the same strategies you would if you were \\nmeeting in person; clothing, body language, and dialogue are important. \\nDepending on the sophistication of the technology, you may experience \\nshort transmission delays.  \\nMake eye contact with the camera, which, to the employer, appears as \\ndirect \"eye contact.\" Remember to check the monitor periodically to \\nobserve the interviewer\\'s body language.  \\nIf speaking on camera makes you nervous, try to practice in front of a video \\ncamera or mirror before your interview.AFTER THE INTERVIEW \\n \\n• Send a thank you note \\nwithin 48 hours! Make sure \\nyou express your continued \\ninterest in the position. \\n• Follow-up with the \\nemployer regarding the \\nposition. One of the \\nquestions you should always \\nask at the end of an \\ninterview is “What is the \\nnext step in the hiring \\nprocess?” If you were given \\npermission during the \\ninterview to follow-up in \\ntwo weeks, you don’t have \\nto worry about contacting \\nthem too soon or too late. \\n• Conduct research on \\npotential salary offerings for \\nthe position. If you need \\nhelp with salary negotiating, \\nplease visit Career \\nDevelopment Services \\nduring Drop-In Career \\nCounseling after the \\ninterview ASAP. \\n \\n \\nSECOND INTERVIEW \\nWhen interviewing you for a long-term position, a prospective employer \\nmay invite you and other finalists to visit the organization. The visit can \\ntake from one hour to an entire day. One purpose is to allow you to meet \\nother staff. The second is to give more people an opportunity to interview \\nyou in greater depth to determine whether a good match is developing.  \\nDo not assume that a second interview will lead to a job offer; ensure you \\nactively listen, ask relevant questions, and collect specific information about \\nthe company so you can elaborate on how your strengths match the \\norganization\\'s requirements. Use the opportunity to observe the work \\nenvironment (physical space, relations between employees, work pace) to \\ndetermine if the setting matches what you are seeking.  \\nAPPROACHES TO INTERVIEWING \\nStructured Interview \\nThe goal of this approach is to reduce bias and assist the employer in \\nmaking an objective decision. Typically, each candidate is asked the same \\nset of questions, responses are recorded, and ratings are assigned to each \\nresponse.  \\nUnstructured Interview \\nIn this format of interview, questions are based on the applicant\\'s resume, \\nso different questions will be posed to each applicant. Without structured \\nguidelines, the conversation can be free flowing, thus making this method \\nof interviewing the most prone to bias. Although this type of interview may \\nseem more casual, you must still be well prepared and know the points \\nyou want to make. Be careful not to provide information you would not \\nhave communicated if the interview was more structured.  \\nEnding the Interview \\nWhen it appears that the interviewer is about to end the interview, you \\nshould make sure you have covered certain points before you leave the \\nroom. Make sure you understand the process that will occur before a \\ncandidate is selected for the job (another interview, meetings with other \\nindividuals in the organization, etc.). Ask the interviewer when you can \\nexpect to hear about a decision or ask when you should make an inquiry \\nas a follow-up. \\nEnthusiastically express your interest in the position (unless you are sure that \\nyou are not interested) and thank the interviewer for interviewing you. Ask \\nfor a business card or ensure that you have the interviewer\\'s name, title, and \\naddress so that you can send a thank you letter. Mak\\ne sure your letter is sent \\nwithin 48 hours of the interview. In addition to being a standard business \\ncourtesy, a thank you letter may tip the scales in your favor if you are in close \\ncontention for the job.Interview Evaluation \\nIf you do not receive a job offer and you felt that the fit was very good, \\nconsider contacting the interviewer for feedback on your performance. Did \\nthe interviewer hire someone better qualified for the position? If so, what \\nadditional qualifications might you need to be hired for a similar position? \\nDid you adequately present your qualifications? If not, stay motivated but \\nlearn from any feedback and make necessary changes for your next \\ninterview. \\nCONTACT INFORMATION \\nCAREER DEVELOPMENT SERVICES \\n \\n \\nOne University Drive, Bell Tower 1548 \\n(805) 437-3270 (office) \\n(805) 437-8899 (fax) \\ncareer.services@csuci.edu \\nFor further assistance please visit us during  \\nDrop-In Career Counseling.')]"

The primary objectives are to:  \\n• Supplement resume information  \\n• Show that you understand your strengths and weaknesses and have a \\nsense of direction  \\n• Enable the employer to evaluate your personality and attitudes in \\nterms of the demands of the organization and the position  \\n• Allow you to gain information about the organization and the job \\nthat is not available through other sources  \\n• Give you and the employer an opportunity to discuss the desirability \\nof further contact or an offer of employment  \\nThe interview is a two-way process. You evaluate the employer while \\nhe/she evaluates you. Since there is no one way of interviewing, you will \\nhave to develop your own style. In order to present yourself well during \\nthe interview, you must be prepared. Preparation builds confidence and \\nenables you to give a better presentation of your qualifications. \\nINTERVIEW PREPARATION  \\nFirst Impressions \\nYour success or failure in an interview can depend on your appearance \\nand the interviewer\\'s first impression of you. Research indicates that, on \\naverage, an interviewer decides to hire in just 5½ minutes. If the first \\nimpression is not positive, it will be difficult to change the interviewer\\'s \\nmind during the rest of the interview.  \\nBe punctual. Arrive 10 minutes early to allow yourself time to collect \\nyour thoughts. Take the opportunity to observe the work environment. \\nKeep your eyes and ears open.  \\nLook professional—neat, clean, and well groomed. Select proper \\nclothing for the type of organization interviewing you. If in doubt, be \\nconservative. It is also advisable to keep fashion accessories to a \\nminimum, to avoid wearing strong scents, and to turn off devices such as \\ncell phones and electronic organizers. \\nGreet each person with respect and professionalism. When you shake \\nhands, make eye contact and smile. Handshakes should be firm but not \\naggressive; try to match the grip of the interviewer. It is good etiquette \\nto wait to sit down until the interviewer invites you to do so.  \\nKnow the Company/Organization \\nYou must be familiar with the position and the organization so that you \\ncan demonstrate your interest in and fit for the job. Refer to the \\nresearch notes you made as you reviewed print and online materials, \\nspoke with people about the position, and prepared your resume and \\ncover letter. \\n \\nINTERVIEW CHECKLIST: \\n• 5-10 copies of your resume \\n• A portfolio/notebook  \\n• Pen/pencil \\n• Questions for the interviewers \\n• Positive attitude \\n• Professionally dressed \\n \\nPROFESSIONAL ATTIRE: \\n• Solid color, conservative suit \\n• Coordinated blouse/shirt \\n• Minimal jewelry/accessories/tie \\n• Moderate shoes \\n• Neat, professional hairstyle \\n• Manicured nailsBEHAVIOR-BASED \\nQUESTIONS \\n• Describe a time when you \\nwere faced with problems or \\nstresses that tested your \\ncoping skills and how you \\nhandled it. \\n \\n• Describe a time when your \\nwork was harshly criticized. \\nHow did you react to this \\nfeedback? \\n \\n• Tell me about a time when a \\nproject really excited you. \\n \\n• Tell me about a situation \\nwhen you had absolutely no \\nidea how to approach a \\nproblem and how you \\neventually solved it. \\n \\n• Give me an example of a \\nsituation when your solution \\nto a problem did not help. \\nWhat was the outcome? \\n \\n• Describe the steps you \\nwould take if a customer \\ncame to you with a problem \\nthat was beyond your \\nresponsibilities but your \\nsupervisor was not available. \\n \\n• How would you handle a co-\\nworker who you notice \\nbeing rude to customers? \\n \\n• Tell me about a time when \\nyou had to adapt to people \\nfrom different cultures and \\nenvironments. \\n•  \\nCAR METHOD TO \\nANSWERING BEHAVIOR-\\nBASED QUESTIONS \\n• Use a three step process:      \\n1) context/situation 2) action \\n3) result or outcome.  \\n \\n \\n \\nA commonly asked interview question is: \"What do you know about our \\ncompany?\" If you are unable to answer this question effectively, \\nemployers will see this as a sign of lack of planning or interest. \\nResearch the Employer \\nThoroughly research the organization to impress those with whom you \\nmeet and discuss your alignment with the company.  \\nSuggested information to research: \\n• Key people in the organization \\n• Size of organization \\n• Location of facilities \\n• Structure of organization'),\n",

Having knowledge of potential \\nquestions helps you to prepare points to include in your answers. Think \\nabout why a question is being asked. What does the employer really \\nwant to know? \\nBehavior-based and situational/hypothetical questions are increasing in \\npopularity because they are considered to be more valid predictors of \\non-the-job performance.  \\nBehavior-Based Questions \\nBehavior-based interviews are designed to elicit information about how \\nyou have performed in the past because past behavior is a good indicator \\nof how you will function in the future. Interviewers develop their \\nquestions around the traits and skills they consider necessary for \\nsucceeding in a position or organization.  \\nThese questions usually begin with phrases such as:  \\n• Tell me about a time...  \\n• Describe a situation in which...  \\n• Recall an instance when…  \\n• Give me an example of…  \\nSome applicants find the format of these questions difficult to understand \\nand have trouble responding. However, if you have done your research \\nand prepared for the interview, you will have work, academic, and life \\nexperiences ready to share. You can prepare for behavior-based \\nquestions by recalling specific actions that demonstrate your• Always cite a specific event and \\nbriefly fill the employer in on \\nthe situation.  \\n• Have a thorough \\nunderstanding of the \\nquestions.  \\n• Ask for clarification if \\nneeded. \\n• Deal with all questions \\npositively. \\n• Some questions give you the \\nchance to acknowledge your \\nfailures while showing how \\nyou have learned from them. \\n• Don\\'t be afraid to take a few \\nmoments to think about the \\nquestion--it\\'s better than \\nmaking something up! \\n \\nEXAMPLE \\n“Tell me about a time you had a \\ndifficult customer. How did you \\nhandle the situation?” \\n \\nWhen I was working at XYZ \\nCompany as an entry-level sales \\nassociate, a customer wanted to \\nreturn an item purchased over \\nnine months ago due to \\ndissatisfaction (Context). I \\ninformed the customer that the \\nproduct no longer met the \\ncompany’s return policy and the \\ncustomer became angry and \\ndemanded to speak with a \\nsupervisor.  I calmly let the \\ncustomer know that I would be \\nhappy to assist them in their \\nrequest and shared other \\nproducts as alternative solutions \\nas the customer waited for a \\nsupervisor (Action).  \\nEventually, the customer calmed \\ndown when I provided suitable \\nalternative options and even \\napologized for being rude to me \\nearlier (Results). \\n \\naccomplishments, abilities, and fit for the position. Be certain to tell the \\ntruth, get to the point, stay focused, turn negatives into positives, and be \\nconsistent with your responses.  \\nAnswering Behavior-Based Questions: W5 Model  \\nThe W5 model is a useful method for answering a behavior-based \\nquestion. The answer should take approximately 90 seconds (the length \\nof a typical attention span). \\n70 seconds - Identify the skill/knowledge/ability and give an example of \\nhow you applied or developed it by explaining:  \\n• What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How  \\n• What the successful outcome was  \\n20 seconds - Re-state the skill and outline the benefits transferable to \\nthe interviewer’s organization  \\nCOMMON BEHAVIOR-BASED INTERVIEW THEMES \\nINCLUDE:  \\n• Working effectively under pressure  \\n• Handling a difficult situation with a co-worker  \\n• Applying good judgment and logic in solving a problem  \\n• Completing a project on time  \\n• Persuading team members to do things your way  \\n• Writing a report or proposal that was well received  \\n• Anticipating potential problems and developing preventative \\nmeasures  \\n• Making an important decision with limited facts and information  \\n• Making a quick decision during the absence of a supervisor  \\n• Making an unpopular decision  \\n• Adapting to a difficult situation'),\n",

Does the interviewer seem to be emphasizing certain \\nskills, knowledge, personality traits, and attitudes? That insight can help you \\ntailor your answers more easily to the employer’s position. \\nFor example, in response to the query \"What experience do you have \\norganizing projects?\" you determine that the qualification being evaluated \\nis organizational skills. Your statement could be, \"I have developed \\nexcellent organizational skills by working on two major projects. The one \\nI would like to tell you about ended successfully six months ago.\"  \\nEvery statement you make must be true! Don’t lie or embellish. Ideally, \\nthe illustration you choose to confirm your statement should be a \\nproject that required similar competency to the typical project theprospective employer wants you to complete. If you do not have a \\nsimilar experience to relate, try to choose a relevant story from your \\nacademic, extracurricular, or volunteer activities.  \\nChoose words that will help the employer visualize you in the \\nexperience. Whenever possible, include positive feedback from \\nsupervisors, colleagues, professors, and others to reinforce your \\naccomplishment.  \\nThe next step is the one that most candidates forget. Tell the interviewer \\nwhat specific benefits or competitive advantage you can bring to the \\nposition because of the experience you have just described. For example, \\n\"As part of the team, I would be able to coordinate....\" Avoid generic \\nstatements such as \"All organizations need people with leadership ability.\"  \\nSituational/Hypothetical Questions  \\nAn interviewer will use situational/hypothetical questions to establish \\nhow you would react to and handle real-life situations on the job. For \\nsituational/hypothetical questions, candidates must have a good \\nunderstanding of the job and its requirements.  \\nHere are some examples of this type of question: \\n• If you had met your project deadlines and your direct supervisor was \\nunavailable, describe how you would remain busy.  \\n• You are the manager of a small marketing team, and one individual is \\ncontinually late for work and taking extended breaks. How would you \\napproach the issue?  \\n• During construction, a contractor unexpectedly finds a very large \\nobject in one of the trenches where he is about to dig. He requests \\nthat you tell him how to proceed. How would you deal with this \\nsituation?  \\n• You plan a workshop to teach newcomers to the country how to use \\nword processing software. Unfortunately, only four people have \\nregistered and you are required to have a class of ten. It is five days \\nbefore the class is scheduled to begin. What do you do?  \\n• You have a conflict with someone who is senior to you and is not \\nyour supervisor. Describe how you would handle it.  \\n \\nCLASSIC QUESTIONS \\nIn addition to asking the other \\ntypes of questions, many employers \\nrely on a series of standard \\nquestions, and you should prepare \\nfor them: \\n \\n• Tell me about yourself. \\n• What are your short-term \\ngoals? What about in two and \\nfive years? How are you \\npreparing to achieve them?  \\n• What is your vision or mission \\nstatement?  \\n• What do you think you will be \\nlooking for in the job following \\nthis position?  \\n• Why do you feel you will be \\nsuccessful in this work?  \\n• What other types of work are \\nyou looking for in addition to \\nthis role?  \\n• What supervisory or \\nleadership roles have you had?  \\n• For you, what are some \\nadvantages and disadvantages \\nof working in a team \\nenvironment?  \\n• What did you like/dislike about \\nyour last job?  \\n• What motivates you to do a \\ngood job?  \\n• What are your \\nstrengths/weaknesses?  \\n• What kinds of problems do \\nyou handle best?  \\n• How do you reduce stress and \\ntry to achieve balance in your \\nlife?  \\n• How did you handle a request \\nto do something contrary to \\nyour moral code or business \\nethics?  \\n• What do you'),\n",

All \\nstories should have a purpose in \\ntelling them, either to highlight \\nsomething you did or to \\ndemonstrate you learned \\nsomething. All stories have a \\nbeginning, middle, and an end. \\nLeave one out and it\\'s not a \\nstory. \\nBEGINNING: Describe the \\nscene so the interviewer \\nunderstands the context. \\nMIDDLE: Next, identify what \\nYOU did to make this happen. \\nBe specific and make sure you \\nare teaching the person \\nsomething positive about you. \\nEND: Share the results of what \\nhappened. Even if it was not \\npositive, what did you learn \\nfrom it? Describe what you \\nwould do differently next time. \\n \\nANSWERING CLASSIC QUESTIONS- PAWS MODEL  \\nThe PAWS model is a useful method for answering classic questions \\nsuch as \"Tell me about yourself.\" The answer should take approximately \\n90 seconds (the length of a typical attention span). \\nWhen an employer asks this question, the employer is looking for those \\naspects of your life that are relevant to the job, such as how you became \\ninterested in the field, related experience, and courses taken. \\nThe \"PAWS\" acronym stands for Profile, Academic, Work, and Skills. \\nInclude all or as many of the four (in any order) to reinforce your fit for \\nthe job. As with any interview response, limit your answer to a \\nmaximum of ninety seconds. Here are some examples of what to discuss \\nin each of the four areas: \\nProfile: Mention how you became interested in this field and perhaps \\npoint out any relevant community involvement, extracurricular activities, \\nmemberships, and personal interests that further demonstrate your \\ncommitment to the field  \\nAcademic: Talk about your educational background \\n(degrees/diplomas/certifications) and other related training and \\nprofessional development initiatives/courses that you participated in  \\nWork: Highlight paid or unpaid experience related to the job  \\nSkills: Refer to specific technical skills that relate to the position or field \\n(programming C++, knowledge of GIS) and relevant transferable skills \\n(time management, problem-solving skills)TRICKY SITUATIONS \\nAwkward situations may occur \\nduring an interview, and it is up \\nto you to be prepared to \\nconfidently handle whatever \\nhappens. To increase your \\nconfidence and prepare for an \\ninterview, practice interviewing. \\nCheck for quality of information \\nin your answers, and the \\npositive, non-verbal \\nreinforcement of your words. \\nBy practicing responses out \\nloud, you can hear your \\nanswers and assess their \\neffectiveness; however, don\\'t \\npractice so much that you lose \\nyour spontaneity and your \\nanswers sound rehearsed. \\nThe key to tricky situations is \\nto remember that barriers to \\nemployment can often be \\novercome by focusing on the \\npositive. Circumstances that \\nyou may find problematic are: \\n1. Salary  \\n2. Silence  \\n3. Interviewer is an excessive \\ntalker  \\n4. Note-taking  \\n5. Being stumped  \\n6. Negative questions  \\n7. Many short-term jobs or \\ngaps in employment history  \\n8. Having never worked or no \\nrecent work experience  \\n9. Being over-/under-qualified  \\n10. Low grades  \\n11. Ageism  \\n12. Disclosure of disability  \\n13. Reasons for leaving last job  \\n14. Poor or no references  \\n15. Proprietary information  \\n \\nSALARY \\nIf applying for short-term work (such as co-op or summer positions), you \\nwill likely have only one interview, so it is acceptable to discuss salary. If \\nyou need to know the salary and it has not been discussed, ask about it as \\nyour final question. \\nEmployers hiring full-time or contract staff may inquire about salary \\nduring a first interview to see if your expectations are compatible with \\nwhat they are offering and to see how much value you place on your \\nexperience, skills, and educational background.

Try to defer the subject \\nuntil you have been offered the job, but if the employer insists, be \\nprepared to offer a salary range that you know is realistic based on your \\nresearch.  \\nOver eighty percent of employers expect you to negotiate salary. \\nTherefore, it is appropriate to do your salary research and develop a \\nnegotiation strategy. Visit the Career Development Center to discuss \\nsalary negotiation techniques with a career counselor. \\nSILENCE \\nIf you answer a question and there is no prompt response or follow-up \\nquestion, what do you do? Try to remain calm and collected. Silence may \\nnot be a negative sign; the employer could be taking time to process and \\nrecord your answer or could be considering the next question. A few \\nemployers create periods of silence during an interview to see how \\ncandidates handle stressful and awkward situations.  \\nIn response to uncomfortable silence, ask the interviewers if they require \\nany further details regarding your last response, shifting the responsibility \\nto them. Resist the temptation to ramble because you may provide \\nirrelevant information that may hurt your chances of being offered the \\njob. \\nNOTE-TAKING \\nAlthough the interviewer will likely take notes, generally you should take \\nbasic notes. If you have your head down writing everything frantically, the \\nconversation will be uncomfortable and disengaged because of your lack \\nof eye contact and inability to show enthusiasm. \\nMaking brief notes is acceptable when you need to record information \\nthat may be easily forgotten, such as a key word, phone number or \\ncontact information. If you fear you may not recall other pertinent \\ndetails, document the information immediately after the interview.BEING STUMPED \\nTry not to focus on “what you \\nshould say.” Focus on the \\npurpose of this question. What \\ndo you think they want to know \\nabout you, based on the question \\nthey asked? They might be \\npurposely testing your ability to \\nsolve problems under pressure.  \\nProvide a response that \\ndemonstrates your process in \\nfinding a solution to a problem.  \\n \\nExample:  What is your \\nexperience with supervising \\nothers? \\n \\n• They might want to know \\nyour leadership style, or \\nhow you handle conflict \\nbetween co-workers. \\n \\n“I haven’t had the opportunity to \\nsupervise others yet.  However, I \\nled my senior capstone project in \\ndeveloping a business \\nplan…(provide detailed info on \\nhow you lead the team).” \\n \\n“In the past three years working \\nat XYZ Company, my leadership \\nresponsibilities have grown  from \\nbeing part of a project team to \\nspearheading a new \\nproject…(provide detail info on \\nhow you’ve increased your \\nleadership opportunity).” \\nBEING STUMPED \\nYou may have difficulty communicating your thoughts clearly and \\nconcisely, especially when you are not sure how to respond to a \\nquestion. The key is to remain calm and positive, focus on the question, \\nand continue to remind yourself that you are doing well. You may \\nrequest clarification if you are not sure what the interviewer is asking or \\npause and politely ask for a few moments to consider your response; \\nhowever, don\\'t take too much time because employers want to see that \\nyou can think well under pressure. \\nAfter a brief pause, if you still cannot respond to the interviewer\\'s \\nquestion, you may ask to defer your answer to the end of the interview. \\nThe risk is that interviews usually follow a certain structure and the \\nquestion might be missed entirely, leaving the interviewer with an \\nunanswered question. Of course, if you’re stumped because you simply \\ndo not know the answer, be honest with the interviewer in a positive \\nand professional manner. \\nWhen asked a question about a skill that you don\\'t have, demonstrate \\nthat you have the transferable skills necessary to succeed in the position. \\nFor example, \"I have excellent computer skills but I do not have \\nknowledge of that specific software. However, I did learn Dreamweaver, \\na similar program, on my own and quickly applied the concepts by \\nindependently creating a website for a project that received a grade of \\n90%.\" \\nNEGATIVE QUESTIONS \\nInterviewers will often ask negatively phrased questions to assess your \\nperceived weaknesses and strengths.

Be sure to end your \"weakness\" response \\non a positive note by indicating what steps you are taking to overcome \\nthe weakness. \\nIt is important to be as positive as possible, even when answering a \\nnegatively framed question, and to keep your answer short.GAPS IN EMPLOYMENT \\nEXPLANATIONS \\n \\n“While I was in between \\npositions, I volunteered at XYZ \\nCompany to improve my \\ncustomer service skills.” \\n“I utilized this gap in \\nemployment to help out my \\nfamily, which also gave me the \\nchance to improve my \\ncomputer and time management \\nskills.  I completed several self-\\nguided courses online through \\nLynda.com” \\n \\nMANY SHORT-TERM JOBS OR GAPS IN \\nEMPLOYMENT HISTORY  \\nIt is becoming more common to work for shorter periods for a variety of \\nemployers, so employers may not place as much emphasis on dates \\nworked as they might have in the past. However, if asked, be prepared to \\nprovide reasons that the employer will understand for your frequent job \\nchanges or gaps in employment history.  \\nGaps in your employment history can occur for many reasons, some \\nwithin and some beyond your control: short-term positions, lay-offs, \\nhealth or personal concerns, raising a family, extensive traveling, \\ncompleting a degree, unemployment, or time for career planning. In \\ncreating a targeted resume, you may also have chosen to omit some \\nexperiences. \\nAlthough you should truthfully explain in a few words the reasons for \\nyour job changes or gaps in employment, focus on what you did during \\nthe gaps that was related to the position. \\nHAVING NEVER WORKED OR NO RECENT \\nWORK EXPERIENCE  \\nTell the interviewer about any relevant courses, workshops, volunteer or \\ninternship experiences, and extracurricular activities. Indicate if you have \\nresearched and joined associations or societies in your field to learn or \\nstay knowledgeable about industry trends and connect with other \\nprofessionals. Convey your interest in the position and indicate that you \\nlook forward to a long-term association with the company. \\nBEING UNDER-/OVER-QUALIFIED \\nAlthough you may be concerned about your qualifications, the \\ninterviewer liked something about your resume or you wouldn’t have \\nbeen offered an interview! Counter the interviewer\\'s fear that you may \\nnot be suitable by emphasizing your positive traits and describing how \\nyour experience, education, and skills will help you succeed in the \\nposition. Demonstrate to the employer your commitment by describing \\nhow the position aligns with your career goals and how your decision to \\napply for the position was carefully planned.  \\nLOW GRADES \\nLow grades can stem from a lack of commitment (such as skipping classes \\nor excessive socializing), enrollment in an unsuitable program, or dealing \\nwith traumatic personal events. In any case, explain briefly and honestly \\nwhat happened and describe what steps you have taken to remedy the \\nsituation so that it is no longer an issue: \"I know my grades were less \\nthan stellar during my third year, but I really improved this term because I \\nattended a series of study skill workshops and they made a huge impact. I \\nnow know how to manage my time successfully, and I’m confident that I \\nwill perform well in this position.\"IF YOU HAVE POOR OR \\nNO REFERENCES: \\nIf you were unable to obtain a \\nreference from your previous \\nplace of employment because \\nyou left on bad terms, you must \\nbriefly explain why. Read the \\nsection on \"Reasons for Leaving \\nLast Job.\" \\nQuickly follow up your \\nstatement to suggest that the \\ninterviewer contact other \\nreferences from your list to \\nobtain a more accurate picture \\nof your previous work \\nexperiences. Stress how direct \\nmanagers, supervisors, teachers, \\n'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={}, page_content=': \\nIf you were unable to obtain a \\nreference from your previous \\nplace of employment because \\nyou left on bad terms, you must \\nbriefly explain why. Read the \\nsection on \"Reasons for Leaving \\nLast Job.\" \\nQuickly follow up your \\nstatement to suggest that the \\ninterviewer contact other \\nreferences from your list to \\nobtain a more accurate picture \\nof your previous work \\nexperiences. Stress how direct \\nmanagers, supervisors, teachers, \\nand colleagues enjoyed working \\nwith you and can attest to your \\nachievements and skills. \\nIf your references are outdated, \\nyou must decide if they are still \\nappropriate to use. If you feel \\nyour referees can still \\nsuccessfully highlight your skills, \\nfollow up with them to request \\ntheir permission to be \\ncontacted by potential \\nemployers. You will also want \\nto remind them of your \\nprevious accomplishments and \\nprovide them with an updated \\nresume. If you do not obtain \\ntheir permission, you must \\nobtain new references by \\nvolunteering, requesting client \\ntestimonials, etc. \\n \\nDISCLOSURE OF DISABILITY \\nPeople with physical, sensory or learning disabilities or chronic medical \\nconditions are advised, like all job seekers, to focus on their abilities and \\ninterests when choosing a career. \\nIt is important to be up front and honest about your situation if your \\ndisability may present a performance barrier or if you need to request \\naccommodation or assistive devices. If you determine that your disability \\ndoes not pose any risk to you or to fellow workers, you may choose to \\ndisclose your disability once a job offer is formally presented. It is not \\nnecessary to disclose your disability in your resume or cover letter, \\nalthough you may prefer to do so if the company you are applying to has \\na specific policy to hire people with disabilities or if you are applying to an \\nagency that deals with persons with disabilities. \\nEmployers may not understand what your disability involves and may feel \\nuncomfortable asking; the result is that they may perceive your disability \\nto be more of a barrier than it actually is. Determine how you can \\novercome or compensate for any perceived or real stumbling blocks to \\nemployment so that you can explain your situation more clearly and \\npositively. For example, you may say, \"Due to a spinal injury, I have no \\nsensation in my legs. I can get around and travel easily in my wheelchair. \\nMy injury does not affect how I think, solve problems, or communicate \\nand will not affect my performance on the job.\" You may also want to ask \\nif the employer has any additional questions. \\nSome regions offer assistance to help you secure employment. As well as \\noffering job placement programs, programs may provide you with \\nspecialized equipment, sign language interpreters, readers, and note \\ntakers to help you with job searching and interviewing. \\nREASONS FOR LEAVING LAST JOB \\nAn employer may inquire about your reasons for leaving a job to \\ndetermine if concerns from a previous job might impact the organization. \\nEmployers like to gauge your attitude toward work, management, \\norganizational change, and policies or guidelines. \\nBegin your response with a positive statement regarding your previous \\nplace of employment. Honestly and concisely state your reasons for \\nleaving. If you left on good terms, offer the interviewer letters of \\nreference that outline your relevant achievements. If the conditions under \\nwhich you left were negative, focus the interviewer’s attention on what \\nyou accomplished and avoid speaking negatively about past managers, \\ncolleagues or the organization. Emphasize that you will be able to handle \\nthe present job no matter what may have happened in the past.YOUR RIGHTS IN THE \\nINTERVIEW \\nThere are clear legal rights and \\nguidelines for employment \\ninterview questions. An \\napplicant for employment may \\nbe asked to divulge only \\ninformation relevant to the \\nposition applied for. By law, an \\nemployer must focus on \\ngathering information relevant \\nto deciding if an applicant can \\nperform the functions of a \\nposition. \\nSome employers mistakenly \\nbelieve that they have a right to \\nask any question they choose \\nsince they are paying the salary. \\nOthers are simply awkward in \\ntheir technique and an unlawful \\nquestion results. However, the \\nlaw does not distinguish \\nbetween the interviewer who is \\nasking questions with the intent \\nto discriminate and the one \\nwho is just curious or inept at \\ninterviewing. \\nSome questions are \\ninappropriate and others are \\nillegal. You do not have to \\nanswer questions that are illegal. \\nMost regions have laws that \\nprohibit discrimination in \\nemployment on the grounds of: \\n• Race  \\n• Ancestry  \\n• Place of origin  \\n• Ethnic origin  \\n• Citizenship  \\n• Religion  \\n• Gender  \\n'),\n",

Revealing information about a past employer, who may \\nor may not be a competitor, could create a breach of confidentiality. \\nEven though you may have worked for this employer some time ago, you \\nare still obligated to keep confidential information private. The \\ninterviewer could be testing to see if you divulge any company \\ninformation because doing so may be an indicator that you will reveal \\nconfidential information about the interviewer\\'s company.  \\nIf your portfolio includes performance reviews or samples of written \\nwork, ensure that no proprietary information is included, such as the \\nnames of customers or clients.  \\nHANDLING ILLEGAL QUESTIONS \\nWhat should you do if you\\'re in the middle of an interview and have just \\nbeen asked what is clearly an illegal question? There is no clear-cut \\nanswer. Much depends on you. \\nIn some cases, you may be able to answer the \"hidden\" question. Think of \\nwhat information the employer is trying to elicit. For example, \"Do you \\nhave or plan to have children?\" may indicate a concern about an ability to \\nwork overtime or to travel. In this example, your answer should convey \\nyour willingness to maintain a flexible work schedule. You may elect to \\nsay \"Why do you ask?\" or \"Would you explain how this point is \\nconnected to the qualifications for this job?\" This could cause the \\nemployer to reconsider or clarify the question. It may offend some \\nemployers, but probably not the majority. \\nIf you feel that you should not answer the question (you shouldn\\'t have \\nto, after all) or that you are not interested in working for the company, \\nyou may state, \"I don\\'t feel obligated to answer personal questions \\nunrelated to the position\" or \"That question seems inappropriate for an \\ninterview.\" If you choose this option, you will either enlighten (the \\nemployer may not realize it is illegal and will be happy that you pointed it \\nout) or offend (the employer may not consider you for the position). \\nFor more information about illegal interview questions, contact your \\nlocal, state or federal employment service office. \\nVERBAL AND NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION \\nSmile when appropriate during the interview. Be enthusiastic and \\nresponsive. As you talk about your past and present activities, your \\npassion and energy can be communicated both through your words and \\nyour body language (an excited tone of voice, leaning forward, nodding \\nyour head in agreement). Maintaining eye contact is important; failure to \\ndo so may imply a lack of confidence or, worse, cause the employer to \\nquestion your truthfulness.QUESTIONS YOU \\nCAN ASK \\nYour questions should be \\npertinent to the position and \\nshow your enthusiasm and \\nknowledge. By asking intelligent, \\nwell-thought-out questions that \\ngenuinely matter to you, you \\nwill convince the employer that \\nyou are serious about the \\norganization and the position. \\nAvoid asking questions \\nmentioned in the interview. \\n• What do you see as the \\npriorities for someone in \\nthis position?  \\n• Please describe a typical day \\non the job.  \\n• What training programs do \\nyou have available for your\\n \\nemployees?  \\n• What level of responsibility \\ncould I expect in this \\nposition?  \\n• What are the company\\'s \\nplans for the future?  \\n• What do you see as the \\ngreatest threat to the \\norganization?  \\n• What/where are the \\ngreatest opportunities for \\nthe organization?  \\n• How would you describe \\nyour organization\\'s \\nmanagement style, culture \\nor working environment?  \\n• What do you like most \\nabout your organization?  \\n• How are employees \\nevaluated and promoted?  \\n \\nSit comfortably, without slouching. Don\\'t put anything on your lap or in \\nyour hands if it will restrict your natural body movement or if you may be \\ntempted to play with it. Keep your clipboard, note pad, briefcase, or \\nportfolio on the floor beside your chair for easy retrieval.  \\nRespond to questions specifically and concisely'),\n",

Don\\'t put anything on your lap or in \\nyour hands if it will restrict your natural body movement or if you may be \\ntempted to play with it. Keep your clipboard, note pad, briefcase, or \\nportfolio on the floor beside your chair for easy retrieval.  \\nRespond to questions specifically and concisely but give sufficient details \\nto enable the interviewer to evaluate your credentials. Interviewers \\nbecome frustrated when they have to listen to long, rambling answers. \\nThink before you speak. It is quite acceptable to pause before talking in \\norder to organize your thoughts. Avoid verbal fillers such as \"um,\" \"ah,\" \\n\"you know,\" or regularly repeating the question to provide thinking time.  \\nUse business language. Avoid slang. Speak clearly. Watch the \\ninterviewer for clues on how the interview is progressing. Is the \\ninterviewer\\'s face or body language telling you that your answers are too \\nlong, not detailed enough, too boring? If in doubt, ask the interviewer if \\nmore or fewer details are needed.  \\nPrepare in advance to talk about any topic that you are concerned or feel \\nuncomfortable about. If there is something that you don’t want an \\ninterviewer to inquire about, it will likely be raised during the interview. \\nPractice your answer out loud often enough to feel confident. Maintain \\npoise and self-control. Consider a difficult issue as a learning opportunity \\nthat has made you a better person. \\nTYPES OF INTERVIEWS  \\nINDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS \\nThe most common interview format is one interviewer interviewing one \\ncandidate, either by phone, via video or in person.  \\nINTERVIEW WITH TWO OR MORE PEOPLE \\nIt is also common to be interviewed by a panel of people. Although it is \\nimportant to have good eye contact with the person who asks you a \\nquestion, also look at the other interviewers frequently to include them in \\nthe discussion. Try to remember each person\\'s name and use his or her \\nname during the interview. \\nGENERAL/GROUP INTERVIEW OR \\nINFORMATION SESSION  \\nThis approach is intended to provide applicants with a large amount of \\ninformation about the organization and the job. The format is used to \\nsave time and ensure that everyone understands the basic facts. This \\nprocess is usually followed by an individual interview. A well-timed and \\nintelligent question may help the employer remember you positively.INTERVIEW RESOURCES \\n \\nVirtual Mock-Interviews on \\nDolphin CareerLink \\n• Practice a mock-interview \\nrecorded on Dolphin \\nCareerLink. \\n• The video can be utilized \\nfor your own purposes or \\nsent to others for review. \\n• You can request CDS staff \\nto review and provide \\nfeedback. \\n \\nMock-Interview during \\nDrop-In Career Counseling \\n• Practice a mock-interview \\nwith CDS staff on a first-\\ncome, first-served basis, \\nwithout an appointment. \\n• The mock-interview will last \\napproximately 15-20 \\nminutes. Then CDS staff \\nwill provide 10-15 minutes \\nof feedback and or \\nsuggestions. \\n• You will need to bring your \\nresume and a copy of the \\nposition description (job \\nposting).  \\n• Even if you are not applying \\nto a specific position, you \\nwill need to bring a sample \\nposition description to \\neffectively conduct a mock-\\ninterview. \\n \\nEmployer Interviews \\n• Each semester, CDS brings \\nvarious local employers on \\ncampus to provide mock-\\ninterviews for students. \\n• Employers will vary each \\nsemester. \\n• Students can register for \\nthis event on Dolphin \\nCareerLink under \\n“Workshops.” \\n• Please visit the CDS \\nwebsite to find out which \\nemployers will be on \\ncampus. \\nCOMPETITIVE GROUP INTERVIEW \\nIn this interview format, one or more people interview many candidates at \\nthe same time. This type of interview is sometimes used when a position \\ninvolves teamwork and the interviewers want to see how you interact in a \\ngroup setting, when the company wants to see who emerges as a leader \\nwithin the group, or when people are being interviewed for several similar \\nroles within the company. It is important to thoughtfully and intelligently \\ncontribute, be attentive to the contributions of others, and not to \\nmonopolize the conversation. \\nTELEPHONE INTERVIEW \\nTelephone interviews are an effective way to quickly and cost-effectively \\nscreen or hire candidates. If there will be more than one interview, the first \\nmay be conducted by phone. Candidates being seriously considered may be \\ninvited to a subsequent on-site interview.  \\nIf you are not ready for'),\n",

It is important to thoughtfully and intelligently \\ncontribute, be attentive to the contributions of others, and not to \\nmonopolize the conversation. \\nTELEPHONE INTERVIEW \\nTelephone interviews are an effective way to quickly and cost-effectively \\nscreen or hire candidates. If there will be more than one interview, the first \\nmay be conducted by phone. Candidates being seriously considered may be \\ninvited to a subsequent on-site interview.  \\nIf you are not ready for an interview when called, politely request that the \\ninterviewer call back at another, mutually convenient, time. This request will \\nallow you to refresh your memory on the organization and consider what \\npoints you want to make.  \\nAll of the advice about interview skills still applies. Your attire is your \\nchoice, but you may find that dressing professionally increases your \\nconfidence and allows you to perform better. Keep your resume, company \\nresearch, points that you want to highlight, and list of questions handy; in \\nfact, keep these in front of you during the interview for easy reference. \\n(Don\\'t shuffle your papers though!) Have a pen and paper available to note \\nany comments or questions that may occur to you during the interview.  \\nChoose your words carefully and be succinct. It is also important to vary \\nyour voice tone, tempo, and pitch to keep the employer\\'s attention. Ensure \\nthat you are in a private setting to eliminate distractions and background \\nnoise. \\nVIDEO CONFERENCING \\nIn this type of interview, recruiters use video technology to conduct \\ninterviews at a distance. Use the same strategies you would if you were \\nmeeting in person; clothing, body language, and dialogue are important. \\nDepending on the sophistication of the technology, you may experience \\nshort transmission delays.  \\nMake eye contact with the camera, which, to the employer, appears as \\ndirect \"eye contact.\" Remember to check the monitor periodically to \\nobserve the interviewer\\'s body language.  \\nIf speaking on camera makes you nervous, try to practice in front of a video \\ncamera or mirror before your interview.AFTER THE INTERVIEW \\n \\n• Send a thank you note \\nwithin 48 hours! Make sure \\nyou express your continued \\ninterest in the position. \\n• Follow-up with the \\nemployer regarding the \\nposition. One of the \\nquestions you should always \\nask at the end of an \\ninterview is “What is the \\nnext step in the hiring \\nprocess?” If you were given \\npermission during the \\ninterview to follow-up in \\ntwo weeks, you don’t have \\nto worry about contacting \\nthem too soon or too late. \\n• Conduct research on \\npotential salary offerings for \\nthe position. If you need \\nhelp with salary negotiating, \\nplease visit Career \\nDevelopment Services \\nduring Drop-In Career \\nCounseling after the \\ninterview ASAP. \\n \\n \\nSECOND INTERVIEW \\nWhen interviewing you for a long-term position, a prospective employer \\nmay invite you and other finalists to visit the organization. The visit can \\ntake from one hour to an entire day. One purpose is to allow you to meet \\nother staff. The second is to give more people an opportunity to interview \\nyou in greater depth to determine whether a good match is developing.  \\nDo not assume that a second interview will lead to a job offer; ensure you \\nactively listen, ask relevant questions, and collect specific information about \\nthe company so you can elaborate on how your strengths match the \\norganization\\'s requirements. Use the opportunity to observe the work \\nenvironment (physical space, relations between employees, work pace) to \\ndetermine if the setting matches what you are seeking.  \\nAPPROACHES TO INTERVIEWING \\nStructured Interview \\nThe goal of this approach is to reduce bias and assist the employer in \\nmaking an objective decision. Typically, each candidate is asked the same \\nset of questions, responses are recorded, and ratings are assigned to each \\nresponse.  \\nUnstructured Interview \\nIn this format of interview, questions are based on the applicant\\'s resume, \\nso different questions will be posed to each applicant. Without structured \\nguidelines, the conversation can be free flowing, thus making this method \\nof interviewing the most prone to bias. Although this type of interview may \\nseem more casual, you must still be well prepared and know the points \\nyou want to make. Be careful not to provide information you would not \\nhave communicated if the interview was more structured.  \\nEnding the Interview \\nWhen it appears that the interviewer is about to end the interview, you \\nshould make sure you have covered certain points before you leave the \\nroom. Make sure you understand the process that will occur before a \\ncandidate is selected for the job (another interview, meetings with other \\nindividuals in the organization, etc.). Ask the interviewer when you can \\nexpect to hear about a decision or ask when you should make an inquiry'),\n",
